Here is a description of what is expected for the "Lab Tree":

- Identify a lab/PI. It must be experienced (at least a 100 publications). Choose wisely: the group should be reknown for it's innovative contributions/way of thinking or amazing production.

- List all publications. Distinguish the paper which came mostly from the lab (first and/or last author) from the collaborative work in which they had a minor contribution. Focus only on the main papers of the lab.

- Sort them by age and topic. It is difficult to attribute one single topic to a paper. It is possible to add several tags to a paper, but you probably will need a dominant tag to build your tree. Unless you go for another way to identify the class and sort the papers. This is open.

- Draw the Lab Tree: the root is the first paper. Branches go on historical order. One branch per topic. Find a good w ay (numerical or manual) to identify and draw the branches. A clever automated tool would be welcome here ! But manual work is also acceptable.Make sure that you don't define dozens of branches or it won't be readable. Attach is an example of what seems usable.

- Interpret the tree !
-> Focus on branch initiation: what did trigger the appearance of a new branch ? A new technique? A new collaboration ? A new idea coming from another paper in the same field ? A very productive/motivated student ?
-> Identify the BIG papers, ie those that have been cited many times (more than 100-200 for example). Where are they positioned in the branch ? Why have they been so influential ?
-> identify the paper in high-rank / selective journals. What justified their publication in such a journal? Have these papers been really influential?
-> identify the short branches. Why were these initiatives non-productive?
You should not read all the papers (you can't anyway). Focus on the main ones identified above.

- Contact the lab director by sending him/her the tree and few lines about your interpretation. Ask for an interview during which he/she is expected to give you some feedback about your interpretations and some hints about the tree structure and the key events which gave it its shape.

- Present the tree and your interpretation. Present your personal interpretation and what you considered interesting in the work and the tree architecture. Present also the feedbacks from the lab director (what could not be captured simply by looking at the list of publication and in the few papers you decided to read).
