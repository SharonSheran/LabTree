At the level of large-scale neural systems, as measured with functional MRI (fMRI), this ongoing activity reflects the organization of a series of highly coherent functional networks. These so-called resting-state networks (RSNs) closely relate to the underlying anatomical connectivity but cannot be understood in those terms alone. Here we review three large-scale neural system models of primate neocortex that emphasize the key contributions of local dynamics, signal transmission delays and noise to the emerging RSNs. We propose that the formation and dissolution of resting-state patterns reflects the exploration of possible functional network configurations around a stable anatomical skeleton."

Its structural architecture has been studied for more than a hundred years; however, its dynamics have been addressed much less thoroughly. In this paper, we review and integrate, in a unifying framework, a variety of computational approaches that have been used to characterize the dynamics of the cortex, as evidenced at different levels of measurement. Computational models at different space–time scales help us understand the fundamental mechanisms that underpin neural processes and relate these processes to neuroscience data. Modeling at the single neuron level is necessary because this is the level at which information is exchanged between the computing elements of the brain; the neurons. Mesoscopic models tell us how neural elements interact to yield emergent behavior at the level of microcolumns and cortical columns. Macroscopic models can inform us about whole brain dynamics and interactions between large-scale neural systems such as cortical regions, the thalamus, and brain stem. Each level of description relates uniquely to neuroscience data, from single-unit recordings, through local field potentials to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and magnetoencephalogram (MEG). Models of the cortex can establish which types of large-scale neuronal networks can perform computations and characterize their emergent properties. Mean-field and related formulations of dynamics also play an essential and complementary role as forward models that can be inverted given empirical data. This makes dynamic models critical in integrating theory and experiments. We argue that elaborating principled and informed models is a prerequisite for grounding empirical neuroscience in a cogent theoretical framework, commensurate with the achievements in the physical sciences."

This so-called “resting state” activity or, more explicitly, the default-mode network, has been associated with daydreaming, free association, stream of consciousness, or inner rehearsal in humans, but similar patterns have also been found under anesthesia and in monkeys. Spatiotemporal activity patterns in the default-mode network are both complex and consistent, which raises the question whether they are the expression of an interesting cognitive architecture or the consequence of intrinsic network constraints. In numerical simulation, we studied the dynamics of a simplified cortical network using 38 noise-driven (Wilson–Cowan) oscillators, which in isolation remain just below their oscillatory threshold. Time delay coupling based on lengths and strengths of primate corticocortical pathways leads to the emergence of 2 sets of 40-Hz oscillators. The sets showed synchronization that was anticorrelated at <0.1 Hz across the sets in line with a wide range of recent experimental observations. Systematic variation of conduction velocity, coupling strength, and noise level indicate a high sensitivity of emerging synchrony as well as simulated blood flow blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) on the underlying parameter values. Optimal sensitivity was observed around conduction velocities of 1–2 m/s, with very weak coupling between oscillators. An additional finding was that the optimal noise level had a characteristic scale, indicating the presence of stochastic resonance, which allows the network dynamics to respond with high sensitivity to changes in diffuse feedback activity."

Furthermore, significant correlations between distinct anatomical regions—or functional connectivity (FC)—have led to the identification of several widely distributed resting-state networks (RSNs). This slow dynamics seems to be highly structured by anatomical connectivity but the mechanism behind it and its relationship with neural activity, particularly in the gamma frequency range, remains largely unknown. Indeed, direct measurements of neuronal activity have revealed similar large-scale correlations, particularly in slow power fluctuations of local field potential gamma frequency range oscillations. To address these questions, we investigated neural dynamics in a large-scale model of the human brain's neural activity. A key ingredient of the model was a structural brain network defined by empirically derived long-range brain connectivity together with the corresponding conduction delays. A neural population, assumed to spontaneously oscillate in the gamma frequency range, was placed at each network node. When these oscillatory units are integrated in the network, they behave as weakly coupled oscillators. The time-delayed interaction between nodes is described by the Kuramoto model of phase oscillators, a biologically-based model of coupled oscillatory systems. For a realistic setting of axonal conduction speed, we show that time-delayed network interaction leads to the emergence of slow neural activity fluctuations, whose patterns correlate significantly with the empirically measured FC. The best agreement of the simulated FC with the empirically measured FC is found for a set of parameters where subsets of nodes tend to synchronize although the network is not globally synchronized. Inside such clusters, the simulated BOLD signal between nodes is found to be correlated, instantiating the empirically observed RSNs. Between clusters, patterns of positive and negative correlations are observed, as described in experimental studies. These results are found to be robust with respect to a biologically plausible range of model parameters. In conclusion, our model suggests how resting-state neural activity can originate from the interplay between the local neural dynamics and the large-scale structure of the brain."

The question of how resting-state functional connectivity (FC) emerges from the brain's anatomical connections has motivated several experimental and computational studies to understand structure-function relationships. However, the mechanistic origin of resting state is obscured by large-scale models' complexity, and a close structure-function relation is still an open problem. Thus, a realistic but simple enough description of relevant brain dynamics is needed. Here, we derived a dynamic mean field model that consistently summarizes the realistic dynamics of a detailed spiking and conductance-based synaptic large-scale network, in which connectivity is constrained by diffusion imaging data from human subjects. The dynamic mean field approximates the ensemble dynamics, whose temporal evolution is dominated by the longest time scale of the system. With this reduction, we demonstrated that FC emerges as structured linear fluctuations around a stable low firing activity state close to destabilization. Moreover, the model can be further and crucially simplified into a set of motion equations for statistical moments, providing a direct analytical link between anatomical structure, neural network dynamics, and FC. Our study suggests that FC arises from noise propagation and dynamical slowing down of fluctuations in an anatomically constrained dynamical system. Altogether, the reduction from spiking models to statistical moments presented here provides a new framework to explicitly understand the building up of FC through neuronal dynamics underpinned by anatomical connections and to drive hypotheses in task-evoked studies and for clinical applications."

The model displays space-based and object-based covert visual search by using attentional top–down feedback from either the posterior parietal or the inferior temporal cortex (IT) modules, and interactions between the two processing streams occurring in V1 and V2. The model explains the gradually increasing magnitude of the attentional modulation that is found in fMRI experiments from earlier visual areas (V1, V2) to higher ventral stream visual areas (V4, IT); how the effective size of the receptive fields of IT neurons becomes smaller in natural cluttered scenes; and makes predictions about interactions between stimuli in their receptive fields."

Although several studies have reported the presence of dynamic functional connectivity (dFC), statistical assessment of the results is not always carried out in a sound way and, in some studies, is even omitted. In this study, we explain why appropriate statistical tests are needed to detect dFC, we describe how they can be carried out and how to assess the performance of dFC measures, and we illustrate the methodology using spontaneous blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI recordings of macaque monkeys under general anesthesia and in human subjects under resting-state conditions. We mainly focus on sliding-window correlations since these are most widely used in assessing dFC, but also consider a recently proposed non-linear measure. The simulations and methodology, however, are general and can be applied to any measure. The results are twofold. First, through simulations, we show that in typical resting-state sessions of 10 min, it is almost impossible to detect dFC using sliding-window correlations. This prediction is validated by both the macaque and the human data: in none of the individual recording sessions was evidence for dFC found. Second, detection power can be considerably increased by session- or subject-averaging of the measures. In doing so, we found that most of the functional connections are in fact dynamic. With this study, we hope to raise awareness of the statistical pitfalls in the assessment of dFC and how they can be avoided by using appropriate statistical methods."

Besides basic research, it is clinically relevant for applications in Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, presurgical planning, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury. Simulations of whole-brain mean-field computational models with realistic connectivity determined by tractography studies enable us to reproduce with accuracy aspects of average FC in the resting state. Most computational studies, however, did not address the prominent non-stationarity in resting state FC, which may result in large intra- and inter-subject variability and thus preclude an accurate individual predictability. Here we show that this non-stationarity reveals a rich structure, characterized by rapid transitions switching between a few discrete FC states. We also show that computational models optimized to fit time-averaged FC do not reproduce these spontaneous state transitions and, thus, are not qualitatively superior to simplified linear stochastic models, which account for the effects of structure alone. We then demonstrate that a slight enhancement of the non-linearity of the network nodes is sufficient to broaden the repertoire of possible network behaviors, leading to modes of fluctuations, reminiscent of some of the most frequently observed Resting State Networks. Because of the noise-driven exploration of this repertoire, the dynamics of FC qualitatively change now and display non-stationary switching similar to empirical resting state recordings (Functional Connectivity Dynamics (FCD)). Thus FCD bear promise to serve as a better biomarker of resting state neural activity and of its pathologic alterations."

We describe a computational neuroscience theoretical framework which shows how an attentional state held in a short term memory in the prefrontal cortex can by top-down processing influence ventral and dorsal stream cortical areas using biased competition to account for many aspects of visual attention. We also show how within the prefrontal cortex an attentional bias can influence the mapping of sensory inputs to motor outputs, and thus play an important role in decision making. We also show how the absence of expected rewards can switch an attentional bias signal, and thus rapidly and flexibly alter cognitive performance. This theoretical framework incorporates spiking and synaptic dynamics which enable single neuron responses, fMRI activations, psychophysical results, the effects of pharmacological agents, and the effects of damage to parts of the system to be explicitly simulated and predicted. This computational neuroscience framework provides an approach for integrating different levels of investigation of brain function, and for understanding the relations between them. The models also directly address how bottom-up and top-down processes interact in visual cognition, and show how some apparently serial processes reflect the operation of interacting parallel distributed systems. # 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Network coherence does not depend on covert cognitive activity, but its strength and integrity relates to behavioral performance. Some RSN are functionally organized as dynamically competing systems both at rest and during tasks.

Small extrinsic perturbations can shape task-related network dynamics, whereas perturbations from intrinsic noise generate excursions reflecting the range of available functional networks. This is particularly advantageous for the efficiency and speed of network mobilization. Thus, the resting state reflects the dynamical capabilities of the brain, which emphasizes the vital interplay of time and space.

Neuroimaging studies have revealed distinct functional networks that slowly activate and deactivate, pointing to the existence of an underlying network dynamics emerging spontaneously during rest, with specific spatial, temporal and spectral characteristics. Several theoretical scenarios have been proposed and tested with the use of large-scale computational models of coupled brain areas. However, a mechanistic explanation that encompasses all the phenomena observed in the brain during rest is still to come. In this review, we provide an overview of the key findings of resting-state activity covering a range of neuroimaging modalities including fMRI, EEG and MEG. We describe how to best define and analyze anatomical and functional brain networks and how unbalancing these networks may lead to problems with mental health. Finally, we review existing large-scale models of resting-state dynamics in health and disease. An important common feature of resting-state models is that the emergence of resting-state functional networks is obtained when the model parameters are such that the system operates at the edge of a bifurcation. At this critical working point, the global network dynamics reveals correlation patterns that are spatially shaped by the underlying anatomical structure, leading to an optimal fit with the empirical BOLD functional connectivity. However, new insights coming from recent studies, including faster oscillatory dynamics and non-stationary functional connectivity, must be taken into account in future models to fully understand the network mechanisms leading to the resting-state activity."

From a computational point of view competition models based on cross-inhibition and adaptation have shown that noise is a crucial force for rivalry and operates in balance with adaptation in order to explain the observed alternations in perception. In particular, noise-driven transitions and adaptation-driven oscillations define two dynamical regimes and the system operates near its boundary. In order to gain insights into the microcircuit dynamics mediating spontaneous perceptual alternations we used a reduced recurrent attractor-based biophysically realistic spiking network well known for working memory, attention and decision-making, where a spike-frequency adaptation mechanism is implemented to account for perceptual bistability. We, thus, derived a consistently reduced four-variable population rate model using mean-field techniques and tested it on BR data collected from human subjects. Our model accounts for experimental data parameters such as time dominance, coefficient of variation and gamma distribution. In addition, we show that our model also operates on the boundary between noise and adaptation and agrees with Levelt’s second revised and fourth propositions. These results show for the first time that a consistent reduction of a biophysically realistic spiking network of integrate and fire neurons with spike frequency adaptation could account for BR. Moreover, we demonstrate that BR can be explained only through the dynamics of the competing neuronal pools, without taking into account the adaptation of inhibitory interneurons..However, adaptation of interneurons affects the optimal parametric space of the system, by decreasing the overall adaptation necessary for the bifurcation to occur."

We show how computations can be performed through stochastic dynamical effects, including the role of noise in enabling probabilistic jumping across barriers in the energy landscape describing the flow of the dynamics in attractor networks.

The same stimulus can lead to different behaviours depending on the situation, or the same behaviour may be elicited by different cueing stimuli. Neurons in the primate prefrontal cortex show task-specific firing activity during working memory delay periods. These neurons provide a neural substrate for mapping stimulus and response in a flexible, context- or rule-dependent, fashion. We describe here an integrate-and-fire network model to explain and investigate the different types of working-memory-related neuronal activity observed. The model contains different populations (or pools) of neurons (as found neurophysiologically) in attractor networks which respond in the delay period to the stimulus object, the stimulus position ('sensory pools'), to combinations of the stimulus sensory properties (e.g. the object identity or object location) and the response ('intermediate pools'), and to the response required (left or right) ('premotor pools'). The pools are arranged hierarchically, are linked by associative synaptic connections, and have global inhibition through inhibitory interneurons to implement competition. It is shown that a biasing attentional input to define the current rule applied to the intermediate pools enables the system to select the correct response in what is a biased competition model of attention. The integrate-and-fire model not only produces realistic spiking dynamicals very similar to the neuronal data but also shows how dopamine could weaken and shorten the persistent neuronal activity in the delay period; and allows us to predict more response errors when dopamine is elevated because there is less different activity in the different pools of competing neurons, resulting in more conflict."

We present test statistics for detecting the presence of higher-order interactions in spike train data by parameterizing these interactions in terms of coefficients of log-linear models. We also present a Bayesian approach for inferring the existence or absence of interactions and estimating their strength. The two methods, the frequentist and the Bayesian one, are shown to be consistent in the sense that interactions that are detected by either method also tend to be detected by the other. A heuristic for the analysis of temporal patterns is also proposed. Finally, a Bayesian test is presented that establishes stochastic differences between recorded segments of data. The methods are applied to experimental data and synthetic data drawn from our statistical models. Our experimental data are drawn from multiunit recordings in the prefrontal cortex of behaving monkeys, the somatosensory cortex of anesthetized rats, and multiunit recordings in the visual cortex of behaving monkeys."

(2004) Neuron, 41, 165–173]. Populations of neurons for each decision in a biased competition attractor network receive a bias input that depends on the firing rates of VPC neurons that code for the two vibrotactile frequencies. The firing rate of the neurons in whichever attractor wins, reflects the sign of the difference in the frequencies (Df) being compared but not the absolute frequencies. However, the transition from the initial spontaneous firing state to one of the two possible attractor states depends probabilistically on the difference of the vibrotactile frequencies scaled by the base frequency. This is due to finite size noise effects related to the spiking activity in the network, and the divisive feedback inhibition implemented through inhibitory interneurons. Thus the neurophysiological basis for a psychophysical effect, Weber’s Law, can be related to statistical fluctuations and divisive inhibition in an attractor decision-making network."

The search for a statistically independent representation can be formulated by the criterion of minimal mutual information, which reduces to decorrelation in the case of gaussian distributions. If nongaussian distributions are to be considered, minimal mutual information is the appropriate generalization of decorrelation as used in linear Principal Component Analyses (PCA). We also generalize to nonlinear transformations by only demanding perfect transmission of information. This leads to a general class of nonlinear transformations, namely symplectic maps. Conservation of information allows us to consider only the statistics of single coordinates. The resulting factorial representation of the joint probability distribution gives a density estimation. We apply this concept to the real world problem of electrical motor fault detection treated as a novelty detection task."

Our simulation results show that the large-scale neuroanatomical connectivity provides an optimal network structure to support a regime with metastable synchronization. In this regime, different subsystems may temporarily synchronize at reduced collective frequencies (falling in the 8–30 Hz range due to the delays) while the global system never fully synchronizes.

We show that a reduced depth in the basins of attraction of cortical attractor states destabilizes the activity at the network level due to the constant statistical fluctuations caused by the stochastic spiking of neurons. In integrate-and-fire network simulations, a decrease in the NMDA receptor conductances, which reduces the depth of the attractor basins, decreases the stability of short-term memory states and increases distractibility. The cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia such as distractibility, working memory deficits, or poor attention could be caused by this instability of attractor states in prefrontal cortical networks. Lower firing rates are also produced, and in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex could account for the negative symptoms, including a reduction of emotions. Decreasing the GABA as well as the NMDA conductances produces not only switches between the attractor states, but also jumps from spontaneous activity into one of the attractors. We relate this to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, including delusions, paranoia, and hallucinations, which may arise because the basins of attraction are shallow and there is instability in temporal lobe semantic memory networks, leading thoughts to move too freely round the attractor energy landscape."

On one hand, neuroimaging studies show that long-range correlations are highly structured in spatiotemporal patterns, known as resting-state networks, on the other hand, neurophysiological reports show that short-range correlations between neighboring neurons are low, despite a large amount of shared presynaptic inputs. Different dynamical mechanisms of local decorrelation have been proposed, among which is feedback inhibition. Here, we investigated the effect of locally regulating the feedback inhibition on the global dynamics of a large-scale brain model, in which the long-range connections are given by diffusion imaging data of human subjects. We used simulations and analytical methods to show that locally constraining the feedback inhibition to compensate for the excess of long-range excitatory connectivity, to preserve the asynchronous state, crucially changes the characteristics of the emergent resting and evoked activity. First, it significantly improves the model's prediction of the empirical human functional connectivity. Second, relaxing this constraint leads to an unrealistic network evoked activity, with systematic coactivation of cortical areas which are components of the default-mode network, whereas regulation of feedback inhibition prevents this. Finally, information theoretic analysis shows that regulation of the local feedback inhibition increases both the entropy and the Fisher information of the network evoked responses. Hence, it enhances the information capacity and the discrimination accuracy of the global network. In conclusion, the local excitation–inhibition ratio impacts the structure of the spontaneous activity and the information transmission at the large-scale brain level."

However, recent studies indicate that resting-state activity is not stationary, but shows complex temporal dynamics. We were interested in the spatiotemporal dynamics of the phase interactions among resting-state fMRI BOLD signals from human subjects. We found that the global phase synchrony of the BOLD signals evolves on a characteristic ultra-slow (<0.01Hz) time scale, and that its temporal variations reflect the transient formation and dissolution of multiple communities of synchronized brain regions. Synchronized communities reoccurred intermittently in time and across scanning sessions. We found that the synchronization communities relate to previously defined functional networks known to be engaged in sensory-motor or cognitive function, called resting-state networks (RSNs), including the default mode network, the somato-motor network, the visual network, the auditory network, the cognitive control networks, the self-referential network, and combinations of these and other RSNs. We studied the mechanism originating the observed spatiotemporal synchronization dynamics by using a network model of phase oscillators connected through the brain’s anatomical connectivity estimated using diffusion imaging human data. The model consistently approximates the temporal and spatial synchronization patterns of the empirical data, and reveals that multiple clusters that transiently synchronize and desynchronize emerge from the complex topology of anatomical connections, provided that oscillators are heterogeneous."

The model developed performs nonlinear decorrelation up to higher orders of the cumulant tensors and results in probabilistically independent components of the output layer. This means that we don't need to assume Gaussian distribution at either the input or the output. The theory presented is related to the unsupervised learning theory of Barlow, which proposes redundancy reduction as the goal of cognition. When nonlinear units are used (sigmoid or higher-order pi-neurons), nonlinear principal component analysis is obtained. In this case, nonlinear manifolds can be reduced to minimum dimension manifolds. If such units are used the network performs a generalized principal component analysis in the sense that non-Gaussian distributions can be linearly decorrelated and higher orders of the correlation tensors are also taken into account. The basic structure of the architecture involves a general transformation that is volume conserving and therefore the entropy, yielding a map without loss of information. Minimization of the mutual information among the output neurons eliminates the redundancy between the outputs and results in statistical decorrelation of the extracted features. This is known as factorial learning. To sum up, this paper presents a model of factorial learning for general nonlinear transformations of an arbitrary non-Gaussian (or Gaussian) environment with statistically nonlinearly correlated input. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of this method."

In this article we focus on the brain from the perspective of a dynamic network and discuss the role of its network constituents in shaping brain dynamics. These constituents include the brain’s structural connectivity, the population dynamics of its network nodes and the time delays involved in signal transmission. In addition, no discussion of brain dynamics would be complete without considering noise and stochastic effects. In fact, there is mounting evidence that the interaction between noise and dynamics plays an important functional role in shaping key brain processes. In particular, we discuss a unifying theoretical framework that explains how structured spatio-temporal resting state patterns emerge from noise driven explorations of unstable or stable oscillatory states. Embracing this perspective, we explore the consequences of network manipulations to understand some of the brain’s dysfunctions, as well as network effects that offer new insights into routes towards therapy, recovery and brain repair. These collective insights will be at the core of a new computational environment, the Virtual Brain, which will allow flexible incorporation of empirical data constraining the brain models to integrate, unify and predict network responses to incipient pathological processes."

We use transfer entropy, an information theoretical measure, to quantify the exchanged information. We show that transferred information depends on the phase relation of the signal, that the amount of exchanged information increases as a function of oscillations in the signal and that the speed of the information transfer increases as a function of synchronization. This implies that synchronization makes information transport more efficient. In summary, our results reinforce the hypothesis that synchronization modulates neuronal interactions and provide further evidence that gamma band synchronization has behavioral relevance."

Based on these data, two different models of the topographical and functional organization of the PFC have been proposed: organization-by-stimulus-domain, and organization-by-process. In this article, we utilize an integrate-and-fire network to model both single-neuron and fMRI data on short-term memory in order to understand data obtained in topologically different parts of the PFC during working memory tasks. We explicitly model the mechanisms that underlie workingmemory-related activity during the execution of delay tasks that have a ''what''-then-''where'' design (with both object and spatial delayed responses within the same trial). The model contains different populations of neurons (as found experimentally) in attractor networks that respond in the delay period to the stimulus object, the stimulus position, and to combinations of both object and position information. The pools are arranged hierarchically and have global inhibition through inhibitory interneurons to implement competi tion. It is shown that a biasing attentional input to define the current relevant information (object or location) enables the system to select the correct neuronal populations during the delay period in what is a biased competition model of attention. The processes occurring at the AMPA and NMDA synapses are dynamically modeled in the integrate-and-fire implementation to produce realistic spiking dynamics. It is shown that the fMRI data characteristic of the dorsal PFC and linked to spatial processing and manipulation of items can be reproduced in the model by a high level of inhibition, whereas the fMRI data characteristic of the ventral PFC and linked to object processing can be produced by a lower level of inhibition, even though the network is itself topographically homogeneous with no spatial topology of the neurons. This article, thus, not only presents a model for how spatial versus object short-term memory could be implemented in the PFC, but also shows that the fMRI BOLD signal measured during such tasks from different parts of the PFC could reflect a higher level of inhibition dorsally, without this dorsal region necessarily being primarily spatial and the ventral region object-related."

We describe a model at the integrate-and-fire neuronal level of the synaptic and spiking mechanisms which can hold an expectation of a reward rule in working memory, and can reverse the reward rule if expected rewards are not obtained. An example of a reward rule is that stimulus 1 is currently associated with reward, and stimulus 2 with punishment. The attractor-based reward rule working memory incorporates a spike-frequency synaptic adaptation mechanism which supports the neural switching between rules by being shut down by a general inhibitory input produced by punishment, so that when the attractor starts up again is in the opposite state. The mechanism can implement one-trial reward reversal, which is a property of orbitofrontal cortex neurons. We show how this reward rule input can operate in a biased competition way to influence which one of two stimuli is currently associated with reward and which with punishment, and to map the stimuli correctly to the reward or punishment representations, providing a basis for action selection required to obtain the reinforcer."

These firing phase preferences could result from combining an oscillation in the input current with a stimulus-dependent static component that would produce the variations in preferred phase, but it remains unclear whether these phases are an epiphenomenon or really affect neuronal interactions—only then could they have a functional role. Here we show that PoFC has a major impact on downstream learning and decoding with the now well established spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). To be precise, we demonstrate with simulations how a single neuron equipped with STDP robustly detects a pattern of input currents automatically encoded in the phases of a subset of its afferents, and repeating at random intervals. Remarkably, learning is possible even when only a small fraction of the afferents (∼10%) exhibits PoFC. The ability of STDP to detect repeating patterns had been noted before in continuous activity, but it turns out that oscillations greatly facilitate learning. A benchmark with more conventional rate-based codes demonstrates the superiority of oscillations and PoFC for both STDP-based learning and the speed of decoding: the oscillation partially formats the input spike times, so that they mainly depend on the current input currents, and can be efficiently learned by STDP and then recognized in just one oscillation cycle. This suggests a major functional role for oscillatory brain activity that has been widely reported experimentally."

In this work, we propose a computational model to investigate the role of a structural disconnection (encompassing putative local/global and axonal/synaptic mechanisms) on the organizational properties of emergent functional networks. The brain's spontaneous neural activity and the corresponding hemodynamic response were simulated using a large-scale network model, consisting of local neural populations coupled through white matter fibers. For a certain coupling strength, simulations reproduced healthy resting-state functional connectivity with graph properties in the range of the ones reported experimentally. When the structural connectivity is decreased, either globally or locally, the resultant simulated functional connectivity exhibited a network reorganization characterized by an increase in hierarchy, efficiency and robustness, a de- crease in small-worldness and clustering and a narrower degree distribution, in the same way as recently reported for schizophrenia patients. Theoretical results indicate that most disconnection-related neuropa- thologies should induce the same qualitative changes in resting-state brain activity."

The attractor network models show how decision confidence is an emergent property; and make testable predictions about the neural processes (including neuronal activity and fMRI signals) involved in decision-making which indicate that the medial prefrontal cortex is involved in reward value-based decision-making. Synaptic facilitation in these models can help to account for sequential vibrotactile decision-making, and for how postponed decision-related responses are made. The randomness in the neuronal spiking-related noise that makes the decision-making probabilistic is shown to be increased by the graded firing rate representations found in the brain, to be decreased by the diluted connectivity, and still to be significant in biologically large networks with thousands of synapses onto each neuron. The stability of these systems is shown to be influenced in different ways by glutamatergic and GABAergic efficacy, leading to a new field of dynamical neuropsychiatry with applications to understanding schizophrenia and obsessive–compulsive disorder. The noise in these systems is shown to be advantageous, and to apply to similar attractor networks involved in short-term memory, long-term memory, attention, and associative thought processes."

We use two additional linear layers and principal component analysis to reduce the dimension of both inputs and internal representations and to transmit the essential information. Thereby neurons with small variance in the output are removed, which results in better generalization properties. Our network and learning rules can also be seen as a procedure to reduce the number of free parameters without using second order information of the error function. As a second strategy we derive a penalty term, which drives the network to keep the variances of the hidden layer outputs small. Experimental results show that thereby the transmitted information is limited, which reduces the noise and gives better generalization.

The spiking network model predicts probabilistic decision- making with faster and larger neuronal responses on easy versus difficult choices, that is as the discriminability ΔI between the choices increases, and these and the synaptic currents in turn predict larger BOLD responses as the discriminability increases. Confidence, which increases with discriminability, thus emerges from the firing rates of the decision-making neurons in the choice attractor network. In two fMRI studies, we confirm these predictions by showing that brain areas such as medial prefrontal cortex area 10 implicated in choice decision-making between pleasant stimuli have BOLD activations linearly related to the easiness of both olfactory and warm pleasantness choices. Further, this signature is not found in orbitofrontal cortex areas that represent on a continuous scale the value of the stimuli, but are not implicated in the choice itself. This provides a unifying and fundamental approach to decision-making and decision confidence, and to how spiking-related noise in the brain affects choice, confidence, synaptic and neuronal activity, and fMRI signals."

Following up on macroscopic studies showing the existence of centrally connected nodes in the mammalian brain, combined with the notion that these putative brain hubs may form a dense interconnected ‘rich club’ collective, we hypothesized that brain connectivity might involve a rich club type of architecture to promote a repertoire of different and flexibly accessible brain functions. With the rich club suggested to play an important role in global brain communication, examining the effects of a rich club organization on the functional repertoire of physical systems in general, and the brain in particular, is of keen interest. Here we elucidate these effects using a spin glass model of neural networks for simulating stable configurations of cortical activity. Using simulations, we show that the presence of a rich club increases the set of attractors and hence the diversity of the functional repertoire over and above the effects produced by scale free type topology alone. Within the networks' overall functional repertoire rich nodes are shown to be important for enabling a high level of dynamic integrations of low-degree nodes to form functional networks. This suggests that the rich club serves as an important backbone for numerous co-activation patterns among peripheral nodes of the network. In addition, applying the spin glass model to empirical anatomical data of the human brain, we show that the positive effects on the functional repertoire attributed to the rich club phenomenon can be observed for the brain as well. We conclude that a rich club organization in network architectures may be crucial for the facilitation and integration of a diverse number of segregated functions."

This formulation suggests that perception has an inherent tendency to induce dynamical instabilities (critical slowing) that enable the brain to respond sensitively to sensory perturbations.

The multistable attractor landscape defines a functionally meaningful dynamic repertoire of the brain network that is inherently present in the neuroanatomical connectivity. We demonstrate that the more entropy of attractors exists, the richer is the dynamical repertoire and consequently the brain network displays more capabilities of computation.

If so, second-order statistics could themselves carry information, rather than being invariably detrimental. Here we show that rate variability and noise correlation vary systematically with stimulus direction in directionally selective middle temporal (MT) neurons, leading to characteristic tuning curves. We show that such tuning emerges in a stochastic recurrent network, for a set of connectivity parameters that overlaps with a single-state scenario and multistability.

Here, we show coherent oscillations in the delta frequency band between parietal and frontal cortices during the decision-making component of a somatosensory discrimination task.

A first important distinction in the processing of information in visual search tasks is its separation in two stages. The first, early ‘‘preattentive’’ stage operates in parallel across the entire visual field extracting single ‘‘primitive features’’ without integrating them. The second ‘‘attentive’’ stage corresponds to the specialized integration of information from a limited part of the field at any one time, i.e. serially. So far, models based on the above mentioned two-stage processes have been able to distinguish features from conjunction search conditions based on the observed slopes of the linear relation between reaction time (i.e., search time) and the number of items in the stimulus array. We propose a neuroscience based model for visual attention that works across the visual field in parallel, but due to its intrinsic dynamics can show the two experimentally observed modes of visual attention, namely: the serial focal attention and the parallel spread of attention over space. The model demonstrates that neither explicit serial focal search nor saliency maps need to be assumed. In the present model the focus of attention is not included in the system but only emerges after convergence of the dynamical behaviour of the neural networks. Furthermore, existing models have not been able to explain the variation of slopes observed in different kinds of conjunction search modes. We hypothesize that the different slopes can be explained by assuming that selective attention is guided by an independent mechanism which corresponds to the independent search for each feature. The model consistently integrates the different neuroscience levels by considering the microscopic neurodynamical mechanism that underlies visual attention, the different brain areas of the dorsal or ‘‘where’’ and ventral or ‘‘what’’ paths of the visual cortex, and behavioural data. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This fact poses limits on information encoding by the neural activity. However, a series of recent neurophysiological experiments have changed this traditional view. Single cell recordings across a variety of species, brain areas, brain states and stimulus conditions demonstrate a remarkable reduction of the neural variability when an external stimulation is applied and when attention is allocated towards a stimulus within a neuron's receptive field, suggesting an enhancement of information encoding. Using an heterogeneously connected neural network model whose dynamics exhibits multiple attractors, we demonstrate here how this variability reduction can arise from a network effect. In the spontaneous state, we show that the high degree of neural variability is mainly due to fluctuation-driven excursions from attractor to attractor. This occurs when, in the parameter space, the network working point is around the bifurcation allowing multistable attractors. The application of an external excitatory drive by stimulation or attention stabilizes one specific attractor, eliminating in this way the transitions between the different attractors and resulting in a net decrease in neural variability over trials. Importantly, non-responsive neurons also exhibit a reduction of variability. Finally, this reduced variability is found to arise from an increased regularity of the neural spike trains. In conclusion, these results suggest that the variability reduction under stimulation and attention is a property of neural circuits."

This phenomenon is governed by an interplay between the internal neural dynamics of cortical areas and their connectivity. Uncovering this complex relationship has raised much interest, both for theory and the interpretation of experimental data (e.g., fMRI recordings) using dynamical models. Here we focus on the so-called inverse problem: the inference of network parameters in a cortical model to reproduce empirically observed activity. Although it has received a lot of interest, recovering directed connectivity for large networks has been rather unsuccessful so far. The present study specifically addresses this point for a noise-diffusion network model. We develop a Lyapunov optimization that iteratively tunes the network connectivity in order to reproduce second-order moments of the node activity, or functional connectivity. We show theoretically and numerically that the use of covariances with both zero and non-zero time shifts is the key to infer directed connectivity. The first main theoretical finding is that an accurate estimation of the underlying network connectivity requires that the time shift for covariances is matched with the time constant of the dynamical system. In addition to the network connectivity, we also adjust the intrinsic noise received by each network node. The framework is applied to experimental fMRI data recorded for subjects at rest. Diffusion-weighted MRI data provide an estimate of anatomical connections, which is incorporated to constrain the cortical model. The empirical covariance structure is reproduced faithfully, especially its temporal component (i.e., time-shifted covariances) in addition to the spatial component that is usually the focus of studies. We find that the cortical interactions, referred to as effective connectivity, in the tuned model are not reciprocal. In particular, hubs are either receptors or feeders: they do not exhibit both strong incoming and outgoing connections. Our results sets a quantitative ground to explore the propagation of activity in the cortex."

At the cellular level, rhythmic synchronization at local and long-range spatial scales complements the attention-induced firing rate changes of neurons. The former is hypothesized to enable efficient communication between neuronal ensembles tuned to spatial and featural aspects of the attended stimulus. Recent modelling studies suggest that the rhythmic synchronization in the gamma range may be mediated by a fine balance between N-methyl-d-aspartate and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate postsynaptic currents, whereas other studies have highlighted the possible contribution of the neuromodulator acetylcholine.

Abstract Neural responses are most often characterized in terms of the sets of environmental or internal conditions or stimuli with which their firing rate increases or decreases are correlated. Their transient (nonstationary) temporal profiles of activity have received comparatively less attention. Similarly, the computational framework of attractor neural networks puts most emphasis on the representational or computational properties of the stable states of a neural system. Here we review a couple of neurophysiological observations and computational ideas that shift the focus to the transient dynamics of neural systems. We argue that there are many situations in which the transient neural behaviour, while hopping between different attractor states or moving along ‘attractor ruins’, carries most of the computational and/or behavioural significance, rather than the attractor states eventually reached. Such transients may be related to the computation of temporally precise predictions or the probabilistic transitions among choice options, accounting for Weber's law in decision-making tasks. Finally, we conclude with a more general perspective on the role of transient dynamics in the brain, promoting the view that brain activity is characterized by a high-dimensional chaotic ground state from which transient spatiotemporal patterns (metastable states) briefly emerge. Neural computation has to exploit the itinerant dynamics between these states."

Furthermore, attentional modulation of firing rates increases along the visual pathway. The other, newer hypothesis assigns synchronization a crucial role in the attentional process. It stems from experiments that have shown that attention modulates gamma-frequency synchronization. In this paper, we study the coexistence of the two phenomena using a theoretical framework. We find that the two effects can vary independently of each other and across layers. Therefore, the two phenomena are not concomitant. However, we show that there is an advantage in the processing of information if rate modulation is accompanied by gamma modulation, namely that reaction times are shorter, implying behavioral relevance for gamma synchronization."

The model consists of three representative modules which encode object classes, spatial locations, and elementary features, respectively. These modules are coupled together in a neural dynamical system in the framework of biased competition. The system can be made to operate in either a spatial or an object attention mode by introducing a top-down bias to either the dorsal or the ventral stream modules.

Moreover, we show that such partial differential neurons provide important input to a subsequent attractor decision-making network that can then compare this combination of the first and second stimuli with inputs from other neurons that respond only to the second stimulus.

Crucially, resting-state FC (rs-FC) between these two areas at pretraining predicted individual differences in learning outcomes after distributed (Experiment 1) and intensive training (Experiment 2). Furthermore, this rs-FC was reduced at posttraining, a change that may also account for learning. Finally, resting-state network analyses showed that the mechanism underlying this reduction of rs-FC was mainly a transfer in intrinsic activity of the left frontal operculum/anterior insula from the left frontoparietal network to the salience network. Thus, rs-FC may contribute to predict learning ability and to understand how learning modifies the functioning of the brain. The discovery of this correspondence between initial spontaneous brain activity in task-related areas and posttraining performance opens new avenues to find predictors of learning capacities in the brain using task-related fMRI and rs-fMRI combined."

Here we show how this could arise as an emergent property in an integrate-and-fire attractor network model of decision making. The attractor network has populations of neurons that respond to each of the possible choices, each biased by the evidence for that choice, and there is competition between the attractor states until one population wins the competition and finishes with high firing that represents the decision. Noise resulting from the random spiking times of individual neurons makes the decision making probabilistic. We also show that a second attractor network can make decisions based on the confidence in the first decision. This system is supported by and accounts for neuronal responses recorded during decision making and makes predictions about the neuronal activity that will be found when a decision is made about whether to stay with a first decision or to abort the trial and start again. The research shows how monitoring can be performed in the brain and this has many implications for understanding cognitive functioning."

In addition, it is believed that the information underlying decision making is carried in the rate of the neuronal response, while its variability is considered unspecific. Here we studied the influence of recent experience on motor decision making by analyzing the activity of neurons in the dorsal premotor area of two monkeys performing a countermanding arm task. We observe that the across-trial variability of the neural response strongly correlates with trial history-dependent changes in reaction time. Using a theoretical model of decision making, we show that a trial history-monitoring signal can explain the observed behavioral and neural modulation. Our study reveals that, in the neural processes that culminate in motor plan maturation, the evidence provided by perception and memory is reflected in mean rate and variance respectively."

Our hypothesis is that early visual areas, such as V1, are important for continual interaction among various higher order visual areas during visual processing. The interaction is mediated by recurrent connections between higher order visual areas and V1, manifested in the longlatency context-sensitive activities often observed in neurophysiological experiments, and is responsible for the re-integration of information analysed by the higher visual areas. Specifically, we considered the case of integrating ‘what’ and ‘where’ information from the ventral and dorsal streams. We found that such a cortical architecture provides simple solutions and fresh insights into the problems of attentional routing and visual search.

At the neuronal level this is supported by increased firing rates of neurons representing the attended object. In primary visual cortex an attention-mediated activity increase depends on the presence of the neuromodulator acetylcholine. Using a spiking network model of visual cortex we have investigated how acetylcholine interacts with biased feedback to enable attentional processing. Although acetylcholine affects cortical processing in a multitude of manners, we restricted our analysis to four of its main established actions. These were (i) a reduction in firing rate adaptation by reduction in M-currents (muscarinic), (ii) an increase in thalamocortical synaptic efficacy by nicotinic presynaptic receptors, (iii) a reduction in lateral interactions by muscarinic presynaptic receptors, and (iv) an increase in inhibitory drive by muscarinic receptors located on inhibitory interneurons. We found that acetylcholine contributes to feedback-mediated attentional modulation, mostly by reducing intracortical interactions and also to some extent by increasing the inhibitory drive. These findings help explain why acetylcholine is necessary for top‐down-driven attentional modulation, and suggest a close interdependence of cholinergic and feedback drive in mediating cognitive function."

An increased depth in the basins of attraction of attractor network states in the brain makes each state too stable, so that it tends to remain locked in that state and can not easily be moved on to another state. We suggest that the different symptoms that may be present in OCD could be related to changes of this type in different brain regions. For example, the difficulty in attentional and cognitive set switching could be related to networks operating in this way in the prefrontal cortex. Repetitive actions and a difficulty in moving to new actions could be related to overstability in networks in the higher order motor, including cingulate areas. In integrateand-fire network simulations, an increase in the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and ⁄ or a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor conductances, which increases the depth of the attractor basins, increases the stability of attractor networks, and makes them less easily moved on to another state by a new stimulus. Increasing c-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-receptor activated currents can partly reverse this overstability. There is now some evidence for overactivity in glutamate transmitter systems in OCD, and the hypothesis presented here shows how some of the symptoms of OCD could be produced by the increase in the stability of attractor networks that is produced by increased glutamatergic activity."

Recently, the focus of experimental as well as modeling studies began to shift from simple binary choices to decision making with multiple alternatives. In this article, we address the question how different numbers of choice alternatives might be handled and encoded in the brain. We present a minimal, biophysically realistic spiking neuron model for decision making with multiple alternatives. Our model accounts for the relevant aspects of recent experimental data of a random-dot motion-discrimination task on both the cellular and behavioral level. Notably, all network parameters and inputs in our network are independent of the number of possible alternatives used in the tested experimental paradigms (2 and 4 alternatives and 2 alternatives with an angular separation of 90°). This avoids the use of extra top-down regulation mechanisms to adapt the network to the number of choices. Furthermore, we show that increasing the number of neurons encoding each choice alternative is positively related to the network's capacity of choice-number-independent decision making. Consequently, our results suggest a physiological advantage of a pooled, multineuron representation of choice alternatives."

To link these two aspects and understand how dynamics and structure interact to form functional brain networks in task and in the resting state, we use theoretical models. The advantage of using theoretical models is that by recreating functional connectivity and time series explicitly from structure and pre-defined dynamics, we can extract critical mechanisms by linking structure and function in ways not directly accessible in the real brain. Recently, resting-state models with varying local dynamics have reproduced empirical functional connectivity patterns, and given support to the view that the brain works at a critical point at the edge of a bifurcation of the system. Here, we present an overview of a modeling approach of the resting brain network and give an application of a neural mass model in the study of complexity changes in aging."

The firing rate response of these neurons was dependent only on the frequency differences between the two applied vibrations, the sign of that difference being the determining factor for correct task performance. We present a biophysically realistic neurodynamical model that can account for the most relevant characteristics of this decision-making-related neural activity. One of the nontrivial predictions of this model is that Weber's law will underlie the perceptual discrimination behavior. We confirmed this prediction in behavioral tests of vibrotactile discrimination in humans and propose a computational explanation of perceptual discrimination that accounts naturally for the emergence of Weber's law. We conclude that the neurodynamical mechanisms and computational principles underlying the decision-making processes in this perceptual discrimination task are consistent with a fluctuation-driven scenario in a multistable regime."

It is accompanied by similarly conspicuous changes in neural dynamics, traditionally exemplified by the change from ""desynchronized"" electroencephalogram activity in wake to globally synchronized slow wave activity of early sleep. However, unit and local field recordings indicate that the transition is more gradual than it might appear: On one hand, local slow waves already appear during wake; on the other hand, slow sleep waves are only rarely global. Studies with functional magnetic resonance imaging also reveal changes in resting-state functional connectivity (FC) between wake and slow wave sleep. However, it remains unclear how resting-state networks may change during this transition period. Here, we employ large-scale modeling of the human cortico-cortical anatomical connectivity to evaluate changes in resting-state FC when the model ""falls asleep"" due to the progressive decrease in arousal-promoting neuromodulation. When cholinergic neuromodulation is parametrically decreased, local slow waves appear, while the overall organization of resting-state networks does not change. Furthermore, we show that these local slow waves are structured macroscopically in networks that resemble the resting-state networks. In contrast, when the neuromodulator decrease further to very low levels, slow waves become global and resting-state networks merge into a single undifferentiated, broadly synchronized network."

One possible mechanism for dealing with this problem is selective attention. Psychophysical evidence strongly suggests that selective attention can enhance the spatial resolution in the input region corresponding to the focus of attention. In this work we adopt a computational neuroscience perspective to analyze the attentional enhancement of spatial resolution in the area containing the objects of interest. We extend and apply the computational model of Deco and Schurmann (2000), which consists of several modules with feedforward and feedback interconnections describing the mutual links between different areas of the visual cortex. Each module analyses the visual input with different spatial resolution and can be thought of as a hierarchical predictor at a given level of resolution. Moreover, each hierarchical predictor has a submodule that consists of a group of neurons performing a biologically based 2D Gabor wavelet transformation at a given resolution level. The attention control decides in which local regions the spatial resolution should be enhanced in a serial fashion. In this sense, the scene is first analyzed at a coarse resolution level, and the focus of attention enhances iteratively the resolution at the location of an object until the object is identified. We propose and simulate new psychophysical experiments where the effect of the attentional enhancement of spatial resolution can be demonstrated by predicting different reaction time profiles in visual search experiments where the target and distractors are defined at different levels of resolution."

We analyse resting-state fMRI data from 98 healthy adults previously categorized as being among the best or among the worst performers in a cohort study of >1000 subjects aged 50+ who underwent neuropsychological assessment. We use a novel approach focusing on the dominant FC pattern captured by the leading eigenvector of dynamic FC matrices. Recurrent FC patterns – or states – are detected and characterized in terms of lifetime, probability of occurrence and switching profiles. We find that poorer cognitive performance is associated with weaker FC temporal similarity together with altered switching between FC states. These results provide new evidence linking the switching dynamics of FC during rest with cognitive performance in later life, reinforcing the functional role of resting-state activity for effective cognitive processing."

Here, we used the rare opportunity to acquire pre- and postoperative diffusion tensor imaging in a patient undergoing deep brain stimulation in bilateral subthalamic nuclei for Parkinson’s Disease. This allowed us to analyse the differences in structural connectivity before and after deep brain stimulation. Further, a computational model of spontaneous brain activity was used to estimate the changes in functional connectivity arising from the specific changes in structural connectivity. Results We found significant localised structural changes as a result of long-term deep brain stimulation. These changes were found in sensory-motor, prefrontal/limbic, and olfactory brain regions which are known to be affected in Parkinson’s Disease. The nature of these changes was an increase of nodal efficiency in most areas and a decrease of nodal efficiency in the precentral sensory-motor area. Importantly, the computational model clearly shows the impact of deep brain stimulation-induced structural alterations on functional brain changes, which is to shift the neural dynamics back towards a healthy regime. The results demonstrate that deep brain stimulation in Parkinson’s Disease leads to a topological reorganisation towards healthy bifurcation of the functional networks measured in controls, which suggests a potential neural mechanism for the alleviation of symptoms. Conclusions The findings suggest that long-term deep brain stimulation has not only restorative effects on the structural connectivity, but also affects the functional connectivity at a global level. Overall, our results support causal changes in human neural plasticity after long-term deep brain stimulation and may help to identify the underlying mechanisms of deep brain stimulation."

To investigate the genesis of such envelope correlations, we consider a whole-brain network model assuming two distinct fundamental scenarios: one where each brain area generates oscillations in a single frequency, and a novel one where each brain area can generate oscillations in multiple frequency bands. The models share, as a common generator of damped oscillations, the normal form of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation operating at the critical border between the steady state and the oscillatory regime. The envelopes of the simulated signals are compared with empirical MEG data using new methods to analyse the envelope dynamics in terms of their phase coherence and stability across the spectrum of carrier frequencies. Considering the whole-brain model with a single frequency generator in each brain area, we obtain the best fit with the empirical MEG data when the fundamental frequency is tuned at 12 Hz. However, when multiple frequency generators are placed at each local brain area, we obtain an improved fit of the spatio-temporal structure of on-going MEG data across all frequency bands. Our results indicate that the brain is likely to operate on multiple frequency channels during rest, introducing a novel dimension for future models of large-scale brain activity."

Sequential learning refers to the ability to encode and represent the temporal order of discrete elements occurring in a sequence. We show that the short-term memory for a sequence of items can be implemented in an autoassociation neural network. Each item is one of the attractor states of the network. The autoassociation network is implemented at the level of integrate-and-fire neurons so that the contributions of different biophysical mechanisms to sequence learning can be investigated. It is shown that if it is a property of the synapses or neurons that support each attractor state that they adapt, then everytime the network is made quiescent (e.g., by inhibition), then the attractor state that emerges next is the next item in the sequence. We show with numerical simulations implementations of the mechanisms using (1) a sodium inactivation-based spike-frequency-adaptation mechanism, (2) a Ca2+-activated K+ current, and (3) short-term synaptic depression, with sequences of up to three items. The network does not need repeated training on a particular sequence and will repeat the items in the order that they were last presented. The time between the items in a sequence is not fixed, allowing the items to be read out as required over a period of up to many seconds. The network thus uses adaptation rather than associative synaptic modification to recall the order of the items in a recently presented sequence."

The dimensionality of the data is first reduced to the first principal component, and then fitted by the stationary solution of a mean-field-like one-dimensional Langevin equation, which describes the motion of a Brownian particle in a potential. The advantage of such description is that the stationary probability density of the dynamical variable can be easily derived. We applied this method to the analysis of cortical network dynamics during up and down states in an anesthetized animal. During deep anesthesia, intracellularly recorded up and down states transitions occurred with high regularity and could not be adequately described by a one-dimensional diffusion equation. Under lighter anesthesia, however, the distributions of the times spent in the up and down states were better fitted by such a model, suggesting a role for noise in determining the time spent in a particular state."

We compared results separately obtained from fMRI and local field potentials (LFPs) under the same anesthesia protocol, finding that while most profound phases of anesthesia can be described by overall sparse connectivity, stereotypical activity and poor functional integration, during lighter states different frequency-specific functional networks emerge, endowing the gradual restoration of structured large-scale activity seen during rest. Noteworthy, our in vivo results show that those areas belonging to the same functional network (the default-mode) exhibited sustained correlated oscillations around 10 Hz throughout the protocol, suggesting the presence of a specific functional backbone that is preserved even during deeper phases of anesthesia. Finally, the overall pattern of results obtained from both imaging and in vivo-recordings suggests that the progressive emergence from deep anesthesia is reflected by a corresponding gradual increase of organized correlated oscillations across the cortex."

The essential point is that, for central neurons, the input is not a continuous signal but a train of spikes which has, in general, a non-periodic distribution. The behavior of an individual neuron is modeled by a combination of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion process and a jump process corresponding to a discrete input spike train. The input spike train is assumed to be given by a Poisson distribution. If the parameters are such that the input spike train provokes a membrane potential that hovers under the threshold, the noise given by the diffusive part of the neuron model induces a maximum in the mutual information between the input and output spike trains. Thus, the stochastic resonance effect results in a strategy for efficient information transmission of subthreshold signals."

A reduction of the firing rates of cortical neurons caused for example by reduced NMDA receptor function (present in schizophrenia) can lead to instability of the high firing rate attractor states that normally implement short-term memory and attention, contributing to the cognitive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Reduced cortical inhibition caused by a reduction of GABA neurotransmis- sion (present in schizophrenia) can lead to instability of the spontaneous firing states of cortical networks, leading to a noise-induced jump to a high firing rate attractor state even in the absence of external inputs, contributing to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. We consider how effects occurring at the time of late adolescence including synaptic pruning, decreases in grey matter volume, and changes in GABA- mediated inhibition and dopamine may contribute to the onset in some individuals of schizophrenia at this time."

It was suggested that criticality could serve as a unifying principle underlying the diversity of dynamics. This view has been supported by the observation of spontaneous bursts of cortical activity with scale-invariant sizes and durations, known as neuronal avalanches, in recordings of mesoscopic cortical signals. However, the existence of neuronal avalanches in spiking activity has been equivocal with studies reporting both its presence and absence. Here, we show that signs of criticality in spiking activity can change between synchronized and desynchronized cortical states. We analyzed the spontaneous activity in the primary visual cortex of the anesthetized cat and the awake monkey, and found that neuronal avalanches and thermodynamic indicators of criticality strongly depend on collective synchrony among neurons, LFP fluctuations, and behavioral state. We found that synchronized states are associated to criticality, large dynamical repertoire and prolonged epochs of eye closure, while desynchronized states are associated to sub-criticality, reduced dynamical repertoire, and eyes open conditions. Our results show that criticality in cortical dynamics is not stationary, but fluctuates during anesthesia and between different vigilance states."

We ground this simulation on structural connectivity obtained from diffusion spectrum imaging data and model it on neuronal population dynamics. Users can interact with BrainX3 in real-time by perturbing brain regions with transient stimulations to observe reverberating network activity, simulate lesion dynamics or implement network analysis functions from a library of graph theoretic measures. BrainX3 can thus be used as a novel immersive platform for exploration and analysis of dynamical activity patterns in brain networks, both at rest or in a task-related state, for discovery of signaling pathways associated to brain function and/or dysfunction and as a tool for virtual neurosurgery. Our results demonstrate these functionalities and shed insight on the dynamics of the resting-state attractor. Specifically, we found that a noisy network seems to favor a low firing attractor state. We also found that the dynamics of a noisy network is less resilient to lesions. Our simulations on TMS perturbations show that even though TMS inhibits most of the network, it also sparsely excites a few regions. This is presumably due to anti-correlations in the dynamics and suggests that even a lesioned network can show sparsely distributed increased activity compared to healthy resting-state, over specific brain areas."

The analysis showed that the activity of primary somatosensory cortex neurons covaried with the stimulus strength but did not covary with the animal's perceptual reports. In contrast, the activity of medial premotor cortex (MPC) neurons did not covary with the stimulus strength but did covary with the animal's perceptual reports. Here, we address the question of how perceptual detection is computed in MPC. In particular, we regard perceptual detection as a bistable neurodynamical phenomenon reflected in the activity of MPC. We show that the activity of MPC is consistent with a decision-making-like scenario of fluctuation-driven computation that causes a probabilistic transition between two bistable states, one corresponding to the case in which the monkey detects the sensory input, the other corresponding to the case in which the monkey does not. Moreover, the high variability activity of MPC neurons both within and between trials reflects stochastic fluctuations that may play a crucial role in the monkey's probabilistic perceptual reports. neurodynamics perceptual detection attractor networks spiking dynamics multistability"

Stable decision attractors are, however, counterintuitive to changes of mind. Here we demonstrate that a biophysically-realistic attractor network with spiking neurons, in its itinerant transients towards the choice attractors, can replicate changes of mind observed recently during a two-alternative random-dot motion (RDM) task. Based on the assumption that the brain continues to evaluate available evidence after the initiation of a decision, the network predicts neural activity during changes of mind and accurately simulates reaction times, performance and percentage of changes dependent on difficulty. Moreover, the model suggests a low decision threshold and high incoming activity that drives the brain region involved in the decision-making process into a dynamical regime close to a bifurcation, which up to now lacked evidence for physiological relevance. Thereby, we further affirmed the general conformance of attractor networks with higher level neural processes and offer experimental predictions to distinguish nonlinear attractor from linear diffusion models."

We review here recent results that show the direct link between brain activity and psychophysically quantified behaviors during a somatosensory detection task. We focus on the following remarkable observation in this somatosensory task: when a near-threshold stimulus is presented, a sensory percept may or may not be produced. These perceptual judgments are believed to be determined by the fluctuation in activity of early sensory cortices. We show, however, that the behavioral outcomes associated with near-threshold stimuli depend on the neuronal fluctuations of more central areas to early somatosensory cortices. Furthermore, we show that the behavioral correlate of perceptual detection is given by a noise-driven transition in a multistable neurodynamical system. Thus, neuronal fluctuations can be an advantage for brain processing because they lead to probabilistic behavior in decision making in this and other sensory tasks."

One of the most robust hallmarks of task/stimulus-driven brain dynamics is the decrease of variability with respect to the spontaneous level, an effect seen across multiple experimental conditions and in brain signals observed at different spatiotemporal scales. Recently, it was observed that the trial-to-trial variability and temporal variance of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals decrease in the task-driven activity. Here we examined the dynamics of a large-scale model of the human cortex to provide a mechanistic understanding of these observations. The model allows computing the statistics of synaptic activity in the spontaneous condition and in putative tasks determined by external inputs to a given subset of brain regions. We demonstrated that external inputs decrease the variance, increase the covariances, and decrease the autocovariance of synaptic activity as a consequence of single node and large-scale network dynamics. Altogether, these changes in network statistics imply a reduction of entropy, meaning that the spontaneous synaptic activity outlines a larger multidimensional activity space than does the task-driven activity. We tested this model’s prediction on fMRI signals from healthy humans acquired during rest and task conditions and found a significant decrease of entropy in the stimulus-driven activity. Altogether, our study proposes a mechanism for increasing the information capacity of brain networks by enlarging the volume of possible activity configurations at rest and reliably settling into a confined stimulus-driven state to allow better transmission of stimulus-related information."

We show that the receptive fields of inferior temporal cortex neurons that implement object representations become small and located at the fovea in complex natural scenes. This facilitates the readout of information about an object that may be reward or punishment associated, and may be the target for action. Top-down biased competition to implement attention has a much weaker effect in complex natural scenes than in otherwise blank scenes with two objects. Part of the solution to the binding problem is thus that competition and the foveal cortical magnification factor emphasize what is present at the fovea, and limit the binding problem. Part of the solution to the binding problem is that neurons respond to combinations of features present in the correct relative spatial positions. Stimulus-dependent neuronal synchrony does not appear to be quantitatively important in feature binding, and in attention, in natural visual scenes, at least in the inferior temporal visual cortex, as shown by information theoretic analyses. The perception of multiple objects in a scene is facilitated by the fact that inferior temporal visual cortex neurons have asymmetrical receptive fields with respect to the fovea in complex scenes. Computational models of this processing are described."

The behavioral relevance of endogenous DMN activity remains elusive, despite an emerging literature correlating resting fMRI fluctuations with memory performance [4, 5]-particularly in DMN regions [6-8]. Mechanistic support for the DMN's role in memory consolidation might come from investigation of large deflections (sharp-waves) in the hippocampal local field potential that co-occur with high-frequency (>80 Hz) oscillations called ripples-both during sleep [9, 10] and awake deliberative periods [11-13]. Ripples are ideally suited for memory consolidation [14, 15], since the reactivation of hippocampal place cell ensembles occurs during ripples [16-19]. Moreover, the number of ripples after learning predicts subsequent memory performance in rodents [20-22] and humans [23], whereas electrical stimulation of the hippocampus after learning interferes with memory consolidation [24-26]. A recent study in macaques showed diffuse fMRI neocortical activation and subcortical deactivation specifically after ripples [27]. Yet it is unclear whether ripples and other hippocampal neural events influence endogenous fluctuations in specific RSNs-like the DMN-unitarily. Here, we examine fMRI datasets from anesthetized monkeys with simultaneous hippocampal electrophysiology recordings, where we observe a dramatic increase in the DMN fMRI signal following ripples, but not following other hippocampal electrophysiological events. Crucially, we find increases in ongoing DMN activity after ripples, but not in other RSNs. Our results relate endogenous DMN fluctuations to hippocampal ripples, thereby linking network-level resting fMRI fluctuations with behaviorally relevant circuit-level neural dynamics."

These experimental findings have motivated the study of biologically plausible winner-take-all network models, in which strong recurrent excitation and feedback inhibition allow the network to form a categorical choice upon stimulation. Choice formation corresponds in these models to the transition from the spontaneous state of the network to a state where neurons selective for one of the choices fire at a high rate and inhibit the activity of the other neurons. This transition has been traditionally induced by an increase in the external input that destabilizes the spontaneous state of the network and forces its relaxation to a decision state. Here we explore a different mechanism by which the system can undergo such transitions while keeping the spontaneous state stable, based on an escape induced by finite-size noise from the spontaneous state. This decision mechanism naturally arises for low stimulus strengths and leads to exponentially distributed decision times when the amount of noise in the system is small. Furthermore, we show using numerical simulations that mean decision times follow in this regime an exponential dependence on the amplitude of noise. The escape mechanism provides thus a dynamical basis for the wide range and variability of decision times observed experimentally."

The local lateral inhibition produces high contrast effects at the edges of each object, and it is when this interacts with gradually increasing damage through the left visual field that the visibility of the left half of each object is especially impaired. This result was found in a formal model completely specified by mean field equations to quantify the dynamical interactions between the modules.

We show how the number of short term memory representations that an attractor network modeling a cortical local network can simultaneously maintain active is increased by using synaptic facilitation of the type found in the prefrontal cortex. We have been able to maintain 9 short term memories active simultaneously in integrate-and-fire simulations where the proportion of neurons in each population, the sparseness, is 0.1, and have confirmed the stability of such a system with mean field analyses. Without synaptic facilitation the system can maintain many fewer memories active in the same network. The system operates because of the effectively increased synaptic strengths formed by the synaptic facilitation just for those pools to which the cue is applied, and then maintenance of this synaptic facilitation in just those pools when the cue is removed by the continuing neuronal firing in those pools. The findings have implications for understanding how several items can be maintained simultaneously in short term memory, how this may be relevant to the implementation of language in the brain, and suggest new approaches to understanding and treating the decline in short term memory that can occur with normal aging."

When a multi-stable visual display is viewed continuously, its phenomenal appearance reverses spontaneously at irregular intervals. We characterized the perceptual dynamics of individual observers in terms of four statistical measures: the distribution of dominance times (mean and variance) and the novel, subtle dependence on prior history (correlation and time-constant). The dynamics of multi-stable perception is known to reflect several stabilizing and destabilizing factors. Phenomenologically, its main aspects are captured by a simplistic computational model with competition, adaptation, and noise. We identified small parameter volumes (~3% of the possible volume) in which the model reproduced both dominance distribution and history-dependence of each observer. For 21 of 24 data sets, the identified volumes clustered tightly (~15% of the possible volume), revealing a consistent `operating regime' of multi-stable perception. The `operating regime' turned out to be marginally stable or, equivalently, near the brink of an oscillatory instability. The chance probability of the observed clustering was <0.02. To understand the functional significance of this empirical `operating regime', we compared it to the theoretical `sweet spot' of the model. We computed this `sweet spot' as the intersection of the parameter volumes in which the model produced stable perceptual outcomes and in which it was sensitive to input modulations. Remarkably, the empirical `operating regime' proved to be largely coextensive with the theoretical `sweet spot'.

One of the most common is electroencephalography, or EEG for short. A net of electrodes is attached to the scalp and reveals the patterns of electrical activity occurring in brain tissue. But while EEG is good at revealing electrical activity across the surface of the scalp, it is less effective at linking the observed activity to specific locations in the brain. Another widely used technique is functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. A patient, or healthy volunteer, lies inside a scanner containing a large magnet. The scanner tracks changes in the level of oxygen at different regions of the brain to provide a measure of how the activity of these regions changes over time. In contrast to EEG, fMRI is good at pinpointing the location of brain activity, but it is an indirect measure of brain activity as it depends on blood flow and several other factors. In terms of understanding how the brain works, EEG and fMRI thus provide different pieces of the puzzle. But there is no easy way to fit these pieces together. Other areas of science have used computer models to merge different sources of data to obtain new insights into complex processes. Schirner et al. now adopt this approach to reveal the workings of the brain that underly signals like EEG and fMRI. After recording structural MRI data from healthy volunteers, Schirner et al. built a computer model of each person’s brain. They then ran simulations with each individual model stimulating it with the person’s EEG to predict the fMRI activity of the same individual. Comparing these predictions with real fMRI data collected at the same time as the EEG confirmed that the predictions were accurate. Importantly, the brain models also displayed many features of neural activity that previously could only be measured by implanting electrodes into the brain. This new approach provides a way of combining experimental data with theories about how the nervous system works. The resulting models can help generate and test ideas about the mechanisms underlying brain activity. Building models of different brains based on data from individual people could also help reveal the biological basis of differences between individuals. This could in turn provide insights into why some individuals are more vulnerable to certain brain diseases and open up new ways to treat these diseases."

Studies of the macroscopic connectome as well as recent neuroimaging and neuromodeling research have suggested a densely connected collective of cortical hubs, termed the rich club, to provide a central workspace for such integration. In order for rich club regions to fulfill this role they must dispose of a dynamic mechanism by which they can actively shape networks of brain regions whose information processing needs to be integrated. A potential candidate for such a mechanism comes in the form of oscillations which might be employed to establish communication channels among relevant brain regions. We explore this possibility using an integrative approach combining whole-brain computational modeling with neuroimaging, wherein we investigate the local dynamics model brain regions need to exhibit in order to fit (dynamic) network behavior empirically observed for resting as well as a range of task states. We find that rich club regions largely exhibit oscillations during task performance but not during rest. Furthermore, oscillations exhibited by rich club regions can harmonize a set of asynchronous brain regions thus supporting functional coupling among them. These findings are in line with the hypothesis that the rich club can actively shape integration using oscillations."

Subsequent feedback processing highlights high-resolution representations in early visual areas and provides spatial detail. To verify this hypothesis, we separate the contributions of feedforward and feedback signals to the selectivity of cortical neurons in a neural network simulation that is modeled after the hierarchical feedforward–feedback organization of cortical areas. We find that in such a network the responses of high-level neurons can initially distinguish between low-resolution aspects of objects but are ‘blind’ to differences in detail. After several feedback–feedforward cycles of processing, however, they can also distinguish between objects that differ in detail. Moreover, we find that our model captures recent paradoxical results of crowding phenomena, showing that spatial detail that is lost in visual crowding is nevertheless able to evoke specific adaptation effects. Our results thus provide an existence proof of the feasibility of novel theoretical models and provide a mechanism to explain various psychophysical and physiological results."

To model the attentional filtering effect, the biased competition model was extended to enable cooperation between stimulus selective neurons. We show that, in a biological relevant minimal model, competition and cooperation between the neurons are sufficient conditions for reproducing the attentional effect. Furthermore, a characterization of the parameter regime where the cooperation effect is observed is presented. Finally, we also reveal parameter regimes where the network has different modes of operation: selective working memory, attentional filtering, pure competition and noncompetitive amplification."

Since these velocities are in the range of action potential velocities through cortico-cortical axons, it has been hypothesized that the observed scalp waves reflect cortico-cortically mediated propagation of cortical oscillations. The reported scalp velocities however, appear to be inconsistent with those estimated from local field potential recordings in dogs, which are < 1 m/s and agree with the propagation velocity of action potentials in intra-cortical axons. In this study, we resolve these diverging findings using a combination of EEG data-analysis and biophysical modeling.

Certain organizational features of the brain have been proposed to be essential to facilitate cognitive flexibility, especially hub regions in the so-called rich club which show dense interconnectivity. These structural hubs have been suggested to be vital for integration and segregation of information. Yet, this has not been evaluated in terms of resulting functional temporal dynamics. A complementary measure covering the temporal aspects of functional connectivity could thus bring new insights into a more complete picture of the integrative nature of brain networks. Here, we use causal whole-brain computational modelling to determine the functional dynamical significance of the rich club and compare this to a new measure of the most functionally relevant brain regions for binding information over time (“dynamical workspace of binding nodes”). We found that removal of the iteratively generated workspace of binding nodes impacts significantly more on measures of integration and encoding of information capability than the removal of the rich club regions. While the rich club procedure produced almost half of the binding nodes, the remaining nodes have low degree yet still play a significant role in the workspace essential for binding information over time and as such goes beyond a description of the structural backbone."

We hypothesize that such a selectivity modulation emerges from the interaction between ITC and other cortical area, presumably the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where the previously learned stimulus categories are encoded. We propose a biologically inspired model of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons with plastic synapses, modified according to a reward based Hebbian learning rule, to explain the experimental results and test the validity of our hypothesis. We assume that the ITC neurons, receiving feature selective inputs, form stronger connections with the category specific neurons to which they are consistently associated in rewarded trials. After learning, the top-down influence of PFC neurons enhances the selectivity of the ITC neurons encoding the behaviorally relevant features of the stimuli, as observed in the experiments.

However, the neural mechanisms governing the entrainment of functionally specialized brain areas remain poorly understood. In particular, the question arises whether observed changes in the regional activity for different cognitive conditions are explained by modifications of the inputs to the brain or its connectivity? We observe that transitions of fMRI activity between areas convey information about the tasks performed by 19 subjects, watching a movie versus a black screen (rest). We use a model-based framework that explains this spatiotemporal functional connectivity pattern by the local variability for 66 cortical regions and the network effective connectivity between them. We find that, among the estimated model parameters, movie viewing affects to a larger extent the local activity, which we interpret as extrinsic changes related to the increased stimulus load. However, detailed changes in the effective connectivity preserve a balance in the propagating activity and select specific pathways such that high-level brain regions integrate visual and auditory information, in particular boosting the communication between the two brain hemispheres. These findings speak to a dynamic coordination underlying the functional integration in the brain."

We applied a whole-brain model based on the normal form of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation and studied the dynamical changes when adapting the bifurcation parameter for all brain nodes to best match wakefulness and slow-wave sleep. Furthermore, we analysed differences in effective connectivity between the two states. In addition to significant changes in functional connectivity, synchrony and metastability, this analysis revealed a significant shift of the global dynamic working point of brain dynamics, from the edge of the transition between damped to sustained oscillations during wakefulness, to a stable focus during slow-wave sleep. Moreover, we identified a significant global decrease in effective interactions during slow-wave sleep. These results suggest a mechanism for the empirical functional changes observed during slow-wave sleep, namely a global shift of the brain’s dynamic working point leading to increased stability and decreased effective connectivity."

To exploit such a modular architecture for computation, the brain has to be able to regulate the flow of spiking activity between these specialized networks. In this Opinion article, we review various prominent mechanisms that may underlie communication between neuronal networks. We show that communication between neuronal networks can be understood as trajectories in a two-dimensional state space, spanned by the properties of the input. Thus, we propose a common framework to understand neuronal communication mediated by seemingly different mechanisms. We also suggest that the nesting of slow (for example, alpha-band and theta-band) oscillations and fast (gamma-band) oscillations can serve as an important control mechanism that allows or prevents spiking signals to be routed between specific networks. We argue that slow oscillations can modulate the time required to establish network resonance or entrainment and, thereby, regulate communication between neuronal networks."

With this method we can detect the embedding dimension by extracting the influence of the past on the future, i.e., the correlation of remote past and future. Optimal embedding dimensions are obtained for the Henon map and the Mackey-Glass series. When noisy data corrupted by colored noise are used, a model is still possible. The noise will then be decorrelated by the network.

In this work we present a biophysically detailed neurodynamical model which illustrates the neuronal base of the processes related to this cognitive flexibility. For this purpose we conducted behavioral experiments which allow the combined evaluation of different aspects of set shifting tasks: uninstructed set shifts as investigated in Wisconsin-like tasks, effects of stimulus congruency as investigated in Stroop-like tasks and the contribution of working memory as investigated in “Delayed-Match-to-Sample” tasks. The work describes how general experimental findings are usable to design the architecture of a biophysical detailed though minimalistic model with a high orientation on neurobiological findings and how, in turn, the simulations support experimental investigations. The resulting model is able to account for experimental and individual response times and error rates and enables the switch of attention as a system inherent model feature: The switching process suggested by the model is based on the memorization of the visual stimuli and does not require any synaptic learning. The operation of the model thus demonstrates with at least a high probability the neuronal dynamics underlying a key component of human behavior: the ability to adapt behavior according to context requirements—cognitive flexibility."

Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying the dynamical stability of brain states using a novel off-line in silico perturbation protocol. We first adjust a whole-brain computational model to the basal dynamics of wakefulness and deep sleep recorded with fMRI in two independent human fMRI datasets. Then, the models of sleep and awake brain states are perturbed using two distinct multifocal protocols either promoting or disrupting synchronization in randomly selected brain areas. Once perturbation is halted, we use a novel measure, the Perturbative Integration Latency Index (PILI), to evaluate the recovery back to baseline. We find a clear distinction between models, consistently showing larger PILI in wakefulness than in deep sleep, corroborating previous experimental findings. In the models, larger recoveries are associated to a critical slowing down induced by a shift in the model's operation point, indicating that the awake brain operates further from a stable equilibrium than deep sleep. This novel approach opens up for a new level of artificial perturbative studies unconstrained by ethical limitations allowing for a deeper investigation of the dynamical properties of different brain states."

Experimental results suggest that STD is modulated by cortical activity, decreasing with activity in the network and increasing during silent states. Here, we explored different activity-modulation protocols in a biophysical network model for which the model displayed less STD when the network was active than when it was silent, in agreement with experimental results. Furthermore, we studied how trains of synaptic potentials had lesser decay during periods of activity (UP states) than during silent periods (DOWN states), providing new experimental predictions. We next tackled the inverse question of what is the impact of modifying STD parameters on the emergent activity of the network, a question difficult to answer experimentally. We found that synaptic depression of cortical connections had a critical role to determine the regime of rhythmic cortical activity. While low STD resulted in an emergent rhythmic activity with short UP states and long DOWN states, increasing STD resulted in longer and more frequent UP states interleaved with short silent periods. A still higher synaptic depression set the network into a non-oscillatory firing regime where DOWN states no longer occurred. The speed of propagation of UP states along the network was not found to be modulated by STD during the oscillatory regime; it remained relatively stable over a range of values of STD. Overall, we found that the mutual interactions between synaptic depression and ongoing network activity are critical to determine the mechanisms that modulate cortical emergent patterns."

Recently, Larsson, Vera, Sebastian-Galles, and Deco [Lexical plasticity in early bilinguals does not alter phoneme categories: I. Neurodynamical modelling. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,20, 76-94, 2008] proposed a biologically plausible computational model to account for some existing data, one which successfully modeled how long-term exposure to a dialect triggers the creation of new lexical entries. One specific prediction of the model was that prelexical (phoneme) representations should not be affected by dialectal exposure (as long as the listener is exposed to both standard and dialectal pronunciations). Here we present a series of experiments testing the predictions of the model. Native listeners of Catalan, with extended exposure to Spanish-accented Catalan, were tested on different auditory lexical decision tasks and phoneme discrimination tasks. Behavioral and electrophysiological recordings were obtained. The results supported the predictions of our model. On the one hand, both error rates and N400 measurements indicated the existence of alternative lexical entries for dialectal varieties. On the other hand, no evidence of alterations at the phoneme level, either in the behavioral discrimination task or in the electrophysiological measurement (MMN), could be detected. The results of the present study are compared with those obtained in short-term laboratory exposures in an attempt to provide an integrative account."

However, the effect of neuronal adaptation in this context has not yet been studied. We begin our study by investigating how adaptation can bias perceptual decisions. We considered behavioral data from an experiment on high-level adaptation-related aftereffects in a perceptual decision task with ambiguous stimuli on humans. To understand the driving force behind the perceptual decision process, a biologically inspired cortical network model was used. Two theoretical scenarios arose for explaining the perceptual switch from the category of the adaptor stimulus to the opposite, nonadapted one. One is noise-driven transition due to the probabilistic spike times of neurons and the other is adaptation-driven transition due to afterhyperpolarization currents. With increasing levels of neural adaptation, the system shifts from a noise-driven to an adaptation-driven modus. The behavioral results show that the underlying model is not just a bistable model, as usual in the decision-making modeling literature, but that neuronal adaptation is high and therefore the working point of the model is in the oscillatory regime. Using the same model parameters, we studied the effect of neural adaptation in a perceptual decision-making task where the same ambiguous stimulus was presented with and without a preceding adaptor stimulus. We find that for different levels of sensory evidence favoring one of the two interpretations of the ambiguous stimulus, higher levels of neural adaptation lead to quicker decisions contributing to a speed–accuracy trade off."

It is frequently difficult in neuroimaging studies to determine this, because it is not easy to establish when the decision has been taken. In a rigorous approach to this issue, we show that in a neurally plausible integrate-and-fire attractor-based model of decision-making, the noise generated by the randomness in the spiking times of neurons can be used to predict a decision for 0.5 s or more before the decision cues are applied. The ongoing noise at the time the decision cues are applied influences which decision will be taken. It is possible to predict on a single trial to more than 68% correct which of two decisions will be taken. The prediction is made from the spontaneous firing before the decision cues are applied in the two populations of neurons that represent the decisions. Thus decisions can be partly predicted even before the decision cues are applied, due to noise in the decision-making process. This analysis has interesting implications for decision-making and free will, for it shows that random neuronal firing times can influence a decision before the evidence for the decision has been provided."

An alternative analytical approach involves the derivation of reduced deterministic differential equations for the moments of the distribution of the activity of the neuronal populations. The study of the reduced deterministic system avoids time consuming computations associated with the need to average over many trials. We apply this technique to describe multistable phenomena.

Although the working memory capacity limit has been thoroughly studied, its origin still remains a matter of strong debate. Only recently has the role of visual saliency in modulating working memory storage capacity been assessed experimentally and proved to provide valuable insights into working memory function. In the computational arena, attractor networks have successfully accounted for psychophysical and neurophysiological data in numerous working memory tasks given their ability to produce a sustained elevated firing rate during a delay period. Here we investigate the mechanisms underlying working memory capacity by means of a biophysically-realistic attractor network with spiking neurons while accounting for two recent experimental observations: 1) the presence of a visually salient item reduces the number of items that can be held in working memory, and 2) visually salient items are commonly kept in memory at the cost of not keeping as many non-salient items. Our model suggests that working memory capacity is determined by two fundamental processes: encoding of visual items into working memory and maintenance of the encoded items upon their removal from the visual display. While maintenance critically depends on the constraints that lateral inhibition imposes to the mnemonic activity, encoding is limited by the ability of the stimulated neural assemblies to reach a sufficiently high level of excitation, a process governed by the dynamics of competition and cooperation among neuronal pools. Encoding is therefore contingent upon the visual working memory task and has led us to introduce the concept of effective working memory capacity (eWMC) in contrast to the maximal upper capacity limit only reached under ideal conditions."

This effect was more pronounced in very specific brain areas such as the thalamus, globus pallidus and orbitofrontal regions of the right hemisphere (with the left hemisphere not analyzed given artifacts arising from the electrode lead). Global aspects of integration and synchronization were also rebalanced. Empirically, we found higher communicability and coherence brain measures during DBS-ON compared to DBS-OFF.

To pinpoint a mapping between structure and function, we investigated the effects of (in)homogeneity in coupling structure and delays on synchronization behavior in networks of oscillatory neural masses by deriving the phase dynamics of these generic networks. For homogeneous delays, the structural coupling matrix is largely preserved in the coupling between phases, resulting in clustered stationary phase distributions. Accordingly, we found only a small number of synchronized groups in the network. Distributed delays, by contrast, introduce inhomogeneity in the phase coupling so that clustered stationary phase distributions no longer exist. The effect of distributed delays mimicked that of structural inhomogeneity. Hence, we argue that phase (de-)synchronization patterns caused by inhomogeneous coupling cannot be distinguished from those caused by distributed delays, at least not by the naked eye. The here-derived analytical expression for the effective coupling between phases as a function of structural coupling constitutes a direct relationship between structural and functional connectivity. Structural connectivity constrains synchronizability that may be modified by the delay distribution.

As in the basis architecture of Rybak et al, the system modules are separated into ‘what’-like subsystems corresponding to the ventral occipito-inferotemporal visual path and ‘where’-like complexes analogous to the dorsal occipito-parietal visual path. The ‘what’ system analyses local features in the actual foveation as in Rybak et al.

Changes in the associations between stimuli and responses require the neural networks to discard the already learned mappings and build new ones. This is a key aspect of cognitive flexibility. In addition, learning within this experimental paradigm requires a trial-and-error exploration strategy of the available stimulus-response associations. A system performing this task must be able to both build up mappings for stimulus-response associations and at the same time perform non-deterministically to explore the behavioural space until it reaches certainty. We hypothesize an integrate-and-fire network model that accounts for the neurophysiological data of a conditional visuomotor association task and is able to show non-deterministic behaviour. We aim at identifying multistable attractor regimes in the network dynamics, which intrinsically enable the system to make errors and thereby to perform trial-and-error exploration. Our model combines cognitive flexibility with multistable attractors in neurodynamical systems, believed to be the basis of decision-making. If multistable attractors support the exploration of the behavioural space, then our model predicts that the brain should respond stochastically with correct or incorrect activity to visuomotor associations until it has reached certainty. This should be visible not only in the corresponding activity in the premotor area, but also in activity corresponding to other associations or even other stimuli in the prefrontal cortex."

For many dynamics, however, intermittent directional couplings arise in causal relation to distinct events on timescales that are often too short to be resolved by nonlinear interdependence measures. On the other hand, in many experimental settings signals are measured for multiple instances of such events. We demonstrate how these multiple realizations can be exploited to reliably detect event-related time-dependent directional couplings. For this purpose, we propose the general concept of time-resolved causal statistics derived from embeddings across multiple realizations of time-dependent dynamics. Surrogates constructed by permuting the order of realizations can be used to test specified null hypotheses. We adapt a conventional nonlinear interdependence measure to serve as a time-resolved causal statistic and apply it to exemplary coupled Lorenz dynamics. This approach allows detecting event-related time-dependent directional couplings based on only a few tens of realizations. Changes of the coupling direction can be detected within one oscillation of the dynamics. Beyond this particular application, any metric bivariate or univariate measure can be adapted to serve as time-resolved causal statistics to characterize various aspects of event-related time-dependent dynamics."

Here we used an in vitro experimental model of cell assemblies, cortical cultures, combined with numerical simulations of a spiking neural network (SNN) to investigate how and why spontaneous synchronization occurs. In order to deal with excitation only, we pharmacologically blocked GABAAergic transmission using bicuculline. Synchronous events in cortical cultures tend to involve almost every cell and to display relatively constant durations. We have thus named these “network spikes” (NS). The inter-NS-intervals (INSIs) proved to be a more interesting phenomenon. In most cortical cultures NSs typically come in series or bursts (“bursts of NSs”, BNS), with short (∼1 s) INSIs and separated by long silent intervals (tens of s), which leads to bimodal INSI distributions. This suggests that a facilitating mechanism is at work, presumably short-term synaptic facilitation, as well as two fatigue mechanisms: one with a short timescale, presumably short-term synaptic depression, and another one with a longer timescale, presumably cellular adaptation. We thus incorporated these three mechanisms into the SNN, which, indeed, produced realistic BNSs. Next, we systematically varied the recurrent excitation for various adaptation timescales. Strong excitability led to frequent, quasi-periodic BNSs (CV∼0), and weak excitability led to rare BNSs, approaching a Poisson process (CV∼1). Experimental cultures appear to operate within an intermediate weakly-synchronized regime (CV∼0.5), with an adaptation timescale in the 2–8 s range, and well described by a Poisson-with-refractory-period model. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the INSI statistics are indeed informative: they allowed us to infer the mechanisms at work, and many parameters that we cannot access experimentally."

These posterior α-oscillations can be recorded throughout the visual cortex and are particularly strong in the calcarine sulcus, where the primary visual cortex is located. The mechanisms and anatomical pathways through which local \alpha-oscillations are coordinated however, are not fully understood. In this study, we used a combination of magnetoencephalography (MEG), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and biophysical modeling to assess the role of white-matter pathways in coordinating cortical α-oscillations. Our findings suggest that primary visual cortex plays a special role in coordinating α-oscillations in higher-order visual regions. Specifically, the amplitudes of α-sources throughout visual cortex could be explained by propagation of α-oscillations from primary visual cortex through white-matter pathways. In particular, α-amplitudes within visual cortex correlated with both the anatomical and functional connection strengths to primary visual cortex. These findings reinforce the notion of posterior α-oscillations as intrinsic oscillations of the visual system. We speculate that they might reflect a default-mode of the visual system during which higher-order visual regions are rhythmically primed for expected visual stimuli by α-oscillations in primary visual cortex."

Here, we combined light-sheet microscopy with GCaMP zebrafish larvae to study whole-brain dynamics in vivo at near single-cell resolution. We show that spontaneous activity propagates in the brain’s three-dimensional space, generating scale-invariant neuronal avalanches with time courses and recurrence times that exhibit statistical self-similarity at different magnitude, temporal, and frequency scales. This suggests that the nervous system operates close to a non-equilibrium phase transition, where a large repertoire of spatial, temporal, and interactive modes can be supported. Finally, we show that gap junctions contribute to the maintenance of criticality and that, during interactions with the environment (sensory inputs and self-generated behaviors), the system is transiently displaced to a more ordered regime, conceivably to limit the potential sensory representations and motor outcomes."

Though each of them has been variously recognized in previous works as expression of the excitability of the cortical tissue and the associated nonlinear dynamics, a unified picture of the determinant factors (dynamical and architectural) is desirable and not yet available. Progress has also been partially hindered by the use of a variety of statistical measures to define the network events of interest. We propose here a common probabilistic definition of network events that, applied to the firing activity of cultured neural networks, highlights the co-occurrence of network spikes, power-law distributed avalanches, and exponentially distributed ‘quasi-orbits’, which offer a third type of collective behavior. A rate model, including synaptic excitation and inhibition with no imposed topology, synaptic short-term depression, and finite-size noise, accounts for all these different, coexisting phenomena. We find that their emergence is largely regulated by the proximity to an oscillatory instability of the dynamics, where the non-linear excitable behavior leads to a self-amplification of activity fluctuations over a wide range of scales in space and time. In this sense, the cultured network dynamics is compatible with an excitation-inhibition balance corresponding to a slightly sub-critical regime. Finally, we propose and test a method to infer the characteristic time of the fatigue process, from the observed time course of the network’s firing rate. Unlike the model, possessing a single fatigue mechanism, the cultured network appears to show multiple time scales, signalling the possible coexistence of different fatigue mechanisms."

Using the latter approach, we compare effective connectivity results in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and control subjects. Methods We used a new approach to the measurement of effective connectivity, in which each brain area has a simple dynamical model, and known anatomical connectivity is used to provide constraints. This helps the approach to measure the effective connectivity between the 94 brain areas parceled in the automated anatomical labeling (AAL2) atlas, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover, we show how the approach can be used to measure the differences in effective connectivity between different groups of individuals, using as an example effective connectivity in the healthy brain and in individuals with depression. The first brainwide resting-state effective-connectivity neuroimaging analysis of depression, with 350 healthy individuals and 336 patients with major depressive disorder, is described. Results Key findings are that the medial orbitofrontal cortex, implicated in reward and subjective pleasure, has reduced effective connectivity from temporal lobe input areas in depression; that the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, implicated in nonreward, has increased activity (variance) in depression, with decreased effective connectivity to and from cortical areas contralateral to language-related areas; and that the hippocampus, implicated in memory, has increased activity (variance) in depression and increased effective connectivity from the temporal pole.

In practice, knowledge about cortico-cortical communication dynamics is minute. One reason is that no current technique can capture the fast spatio-temporal cortico-cortical evolution of action potential transmission and membrane conductances with sufficient spatial resolution. A combination of optogenetics and monosynaptic tracing with virus can reveal the spatio-temporal cortico-cortical dynamics of specific neurons and their targets, but does not reveal how the dynamics evolves under natural conditions. Spontaneous ongoing action potentials also spread across cortical areas and are difficult to separate from structured evoked and intrinsic brain activity such as thinking. At a certain state of evolution, the dynamics may engage larger populations of neurons to drive the brain to decisions, percepts and behaviors. For example, successfully evolving dynamics to sensory transients can appear at the mesoscopic scale revealing how the transient is perceived. As a consequence of these methodological and conceptual difficulties, studies in this field comprise a wide range of computational models, large-scale measurements (e.g., by MEG, EEG), and a combination of invasive measurements in animal experiments. Further obstacles and challenges of studying cortico-cortical communication dynamics are outlined in this critical review."

We show how this noise interacting with altered depth in the basins of attraction of networks involved in short-term memory, attention, and episodic memory provide an approach to understanding some of the cognitive changes in normal aging. The effects of the neurobiological changes in aging that are considered include reduced synaptic modification and maintenance during learning produced in part through reduced acetylcholine in normal aging, reduced dopamine which reduces NMDA-receptor mediated effects, reduced noradrenaline which increases cAMP and thus shunts excitatory synaptic inputs, and the effects of a reduction in acetylcholine in increasing spike frequency adaptation. Using integrate-and-fire simulations of an attractor network implementing memory recall and short-term memory, it is shown that all these changes associated with aging reduce the firing rates of the excitatory neurons, which in turn reduce the depth of the basins of attraction, resulting in a much decreased probability in maintaining in short-term memory what has been recalled from the attractor network. This stochastic dynamics approach opens up new ways to understand and potentially treat the effects of normal aging on memory and cognitive functions."

Upon modeling spike trains as binary time series, we used a nonparametric Bayesian method to estimate pairwise directional correlations between many pairs of neurons throughout different stages of the task, namely, perception, working memory, decision making, and motor report. We find that solving the task involves feedforward and feedback correlation paths linking sensory and motor areas during certain task intervals. Specifically, information is communicated by task-driven neural correlations that are significantly delayed across secondary somatosensory cortex, premotor, and motor areas when decision making takes place. Crucially, when sensory comparison is no longer requested for task performance, a major proportion of directional correlations consistently vanish across all cortical areas."

Here we test the hypothesis that focal lesions decrease the brain's information processing capacity, of which changes in functional connectivity may be a measurable correlate. To measure processing capacity, we turned to whole brain computational modelling to estimate the integration and segregation of information in brain networks. First, we measured functional connectivity between different brain areas with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy subjects (n = 26), and subjects who had suffered a cortical stroke (n = 36). We then used a whole-brain network model that coupled average excitatory activities of local regions via anatomical connectivity. Model parameters were optimized in each healthy or stroke participant to maximize correlation between model and empirical functional connectivity, so that the model's effective connectivity was a veridical representation of healthy or lesioned brain networks. Subsequently, we calculated two model-based measures: 'integration', a graph theoretical measure obtained from functional connectivity, which measures the connectedness of brain networks, and 'information capacity', an information theoretical measure that cannot be obtained empirically, representative of the segregative ability of brain networks to encode distinct stimuli. We found that both measures were decreased in stroke patients, as compared to healthy controls, particularly at the level of resting-state networks. Furthermore, we found that these measures, especially information capacity, correlate with measures of behavioural impairment and the segregation of resting-state networks empirically measured. This study shows that focal lesions affect the brain's ability to represent stimuli and task states, and that information capacity measured through whole brain models is a theory-driven measure of processing capacity that could be used as a biomarker of injury for outcome prediction or target for rehabilitation intervention."

This has proven a significant paradigm shift from the study of individual brain regions in isolation. Graph-based models of the brain consist of vertices, which represent distinct brain areas, and edges which encode the presence (or absence) of a structural or functional relationship between each pair of vertices. By definition, any graph metric will be defined upon this dyadic representation of the brain activity. It is however unclear to what extent these dyadic relationships can capture the brain’s complex functional architecture and the encoding of information in distributed networks. Moreover, because network representations of global brain activity are derived from measures that have a continuous response (i.e. interregional BOLD signals), it is methodologically complex to characterize the architecture of functional networks using traditional graph-based approaches. In the present study, we investigate the relationship between standard network metrics computed from dyadic interactions in a functional network, and a metric defined on the persistence homological scaffold of the network, which is a summary of the persistent homology structure of resting-state fMRI data. The persistence homological scaffold is a summary network that differs in important ways from the standard network representations of functional neuroimaging data: i) it is constructed using the information from all edge weights comprised in the original network without applying an ad hoc threshold and ii) as a summary of persistent homology, it considers the contributions of simplicial structures to the network organization rather than dyadic edge-vertices interactions. We investigated the information domain captured by the persistence homological scaffold by computing the strength of each node in the scaffold and comparing it to local graph metrics traditionally employed in neuroimaging studies. We conclude that the persistence scaffold enables the identification of network elements that may support the functional integration of information across distributed brain networks."

Then, we systematically manipulated the underlying dynamics of the model to investigate simulated changes in FC based on the healthy control subjects. Furthermore, we found distinct patterns involving CSF biomarkers of amyloid-beta (Aβ1 − 42) total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). CSF Aβ1 − 42 was associated to the contrast between healthy control subjects and clinical groups. Nevertheless, tau CSF biomarkers were associated to the variability in whole-brain synchronization and sensory integration regions. These associations were robust across clinical groups, unlike the associations that were found for CSF Aβ1 − 42. APOE4 carriership showed no significant correlations with the connectivity measures."

Redundancy minimization can be achieved by minimization of the mutual information between the units of the output layer. Complete information transfer is enforced by maximizing the mutual information of the input and output. With these two conditions we define a novel learning algorithm for stochastic recurrent networks. The minimum of redundancy corresponds to the extraction of statistically independent features, leading to a factorial representation of the environment. The resulting learning rule includes Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning terms. These two terms are weighted by the amount of information transmitted in the learning synapse minus the grade of redundant information in the corresponding output neuron, giving thus, an information-theoretic interpretation of the proportionality constant of Hebb's biological rule. Simulations demonstrate the performance of this method. When a retina is simulated, the learning algorithm forms decorrelated receptive fields. This represents the first experiment that extends the results of the linear principle component analysis to the nonlinear case by a direct implementation of Barlow's principle of redundancy reduction for unsupervised features extraction by receptive fields formation in a retina model. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd."

Here, we show that monkeys' amygdala neurons derive object values from observation and use these values to simulate a partner monkey's decision process. While monkeys alternated making reward-based choices, amygdala neurons encoded object-specific values learned from observation. Dynamic activities converted these values to representations of the recorded monkey's own choices. Surprisingly, the same activity patterns unfolded spontaneously before partner's choices in separate neurons, as if these neurons simulated the partner's decision-making. These ""simulation neurons"" encoded signatures of mutual-inhibitory decision computation, including value comparisons and value-to-choice conversions, resulting in accurate predictions of partner's choices. Population decoding identified differential contributions of amygdala subnuclei. Biophysical modeling of amygdala circuits showed that simulation neurons emerge naturally from convergence between object-value neurons and self-other neurons. By simulating decision computations during observation, these neurons could allow primates to reconstruct their social partners' mental states."

Using an information theoretic approach, we show that information about the forthcoming action becomes available from the activity of neurons in the medial premotor cortex in a sequential decision-making task after the second stimulus is applied, providing the information for a decision about whether the first or second stimulus is higher in vibrotactile frequency. The information then decays in a 3-s delay period in which the neuronal activity declines before the behavioral response can be made. The information then increases again when the behavioral response is required. We model this neuronal activity using an attractor decision-making network in which information reflecting the decision is maintained at a low level during the delay period, and is then selectively restored by a nonspecific input when the response is required. One mechanism for the short-term memory is synaptic facilitation, which can implement a mechanism for postponed decisions that can be correct even when there is little neuronal firing during the delay period before the postponed decision. Another mechanism is graded firing rates by different neurons in the delay period, with restoration by the nonspecific input of the low-rate activity from the higher-rate neurons still firing in the delay period. These mechanisms can account for the decision making and for the memory of the decision before a response can be made, which are evident in the activity of neurons in the medial premotor cortex."

These models also emphasise particular factors (e.g., the dynamics of performance in relation to real-time neuronal processing) that are not highlighted in other approaches and which can be tested empirically. We illustrate our argument from neural-level models that select stimuli by biased competition. We show that a model with biased competition dynamics can simulate data ranging from physiological studies of single cell activity (Study 1) to ‘whole system’ behavior in human visual search (Study 2), while also capturing effects at ‘intermediate level’, including performance break down after neural lesion (Study 3) and data from brain imaging (Study 4). We also show that, at each level of analysis novel predictions can be derived from the biologically plausible parameters adopted, which we proceed to test (Study 5). We argue that, at least for studying the dynamics of visual attention, the approach productively links single cell to psychological data."

The regions where only a noisy behavior is observed should be ignored. Information about the predictability can be used for example to select regions where a temporal structure is visible in order to select data for training a neural network for prediction. In this paper, we present a non-parametric cumulant based statistical approach for detecting linear and nonlinear statistical dependences in non-stationary time series. The statistical dependence is detected by measuring the predictability, which tests the null hypothesis of statistical independence, expressed in Fourier-space, by the surrogate method. Therefore, the predictability is defined as a higher-order cumulant based significance, discriminating between the original data and a set of scrambled surrogate data which correspond to the null hypothesis of a non-causal relationship between past and present. In this formulation nonlinear and non-Gaussian temporal dependences can be detected in time series. We apply the herein presented data selection method to the task of predicting the daily relative differences of the DAX given 12 inputs.

Disentangling these contributions is crucial for real-life applications, in particular when only a few recording sessions are available. The present study aims to define a reliable standard for the extraction of multiple signatures from fMRI data, while verifying that they do not mix information about the different modalities (e.g., subjects and conditions such as tasks performed by them). In particular, condition-specific signatures should not be contaminated by subject-related information, since they aim to generalize over subjects. Practically, signatures correspond to subnetworks of directed interactions between brain regions (typically 100 covering the whole brain) supporting the subject and condition identification for single fMRI sessions. The key for robust prediction is using effective connectivity instead of functional connectivity. Our method demonstrates excellent generalization capabilities for subject identification in two datasets, using only a few sessions per subject as reference. Using another dataset with resting state and movie viewing, we show that the two signatures related to subjects and tasks correspond to distinct subnetworks, which are thus topologically orthogonal. Our results set solid foundations for applications tailored to individual subjects, such as clinical diagnostic."

A collection of structural cortical hubs-referred to as the rich club-has been hypothesized to support task-specific functional integration. In the present paper, we use a whole-cortex model to estimate directed interactions between 68 cortical regions from functional magnetic resonance imaging activity for four different tasks (reflecting different cognitive domains) and resting state. We analyze the state-dependent input and output effective connectivity (EC) of the structural rich club and relate these to whole-cortex dynamics and network reconfigurations. We find that the cortical rich club exhibits an increase in outgoing EC during task performance as compared with rest while incoming connectivity remains constant. Increased outgoing connectivity targets a sparse set of peripheral regions with specific regions strongly overlapping between tasks. At the same time, community detection analyses reveal massive reorganizations of interactions among peripheral regions, including those serving as target of increased rich club output. This suggests that while peripheral regions may play a role in several tasks, their concrete interplay might nonetheless be task-specific. Furthermore, we observe that whole-cortex dynamics are faster during task as compared with rest. The decoupling effects usually accompanying faster dynamics appear to be counteracted by the increased rich club outgoing EC. Together our findings speak to a gating mechanism of the rich club that supports fast-paced information exchange among relevant peripheral regions in a task-specific and goal-directed fashion, while constantly listening to the whole network."

It has been applied mainly to how oscillations interact in connected networks. We tested by simulations whether information transmission about an external stimulus from one network to a second network is influenced by gamma oscillations, by whether the oscillations are coherent, and by their phase. Gamma oscillations were induced by increasing the relative conductance of AMPA to NMDA excitatory synapses. It was found that small associative connection strengths between the networks were sufficient to produce information transmission (measured by Shannon mutual information) such that the second attractor network took the correct decision based on the state of the first network. Although gamma oscillations were present in both networks, the synaptic connections sufficient for perfect information transmission about the stimulus presented to the network (100% correct, 1 bit of information) were insufficiently strong to produce coherence, or phase-locking, between the two networks; this only occurred when the synaptic strengths between the networks were increased by > 10 ×. Further, the phase of the oscillations between the networks did not influence the information transmission or its speed at these connection strengths. Moreover, information transmission was as good when the AMPA-to-NMDA ratio was reduced to its normal value, and oscillations were not present. Similar results were found when the second network was not an attractor decision-making network. Thus information transmission can occur before synapses have been made sufficiently strong to produce coherence."

We analyze using integrate- and-fi re simulations of attractor networks how some of the symptoms of schizophrenia could be related to a reduced depth of basins of attraction, produced by for example a decrease in the NMDA receptor conductances, and to statistical fl uctua- tions caused by stochastic spike fi ring of neurons. Both of these processes contribute to instability in short term memory, attentional, and seman- tic neuronal networks. The cognitive symptoms such as distractibility, working memory defi cits or poor attention could be caused by this insta- bility of attractor states in prefrontal cortical networks. Lower fi ring rates are also produced, and in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex could account for the negative symptoms including a reduction of emotions. If the decrease in NMDA conductances, and the statistical fl uc- tuations, are combined with a reduction of GABA conductances, this causes the network to switch between the attractor states, and to jump from spontaneous activity into one of the attractors. We relate this to the positive symptoms of schiz- ophrenia including delusions, paranoia, and hal- lucinations, which may arise because the basins of attraction are shallow and there is instability in temporal lobe semantic memory networks, leading thoughts to move too freely round the attractor energy landscape."

DBS relies on precise targeting of specific brain regions to rebalance the oscillatory behaviour of whole-brain neural networks.

There are, however, no good animal models of psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia, and progress in this area has been slow. In this paper, we use advanced tractography combined with whole-brain anatomical parcellation to provide a rational foundation for identifying the connectivity ‘fingerprint’ of existing, successful DBS targets. This knowledge can then be used pre-surgically and even potentially for the discovery of novel targets. First, using data from our recent case series of cingulate DBS for patients with treatment-resistant chronic pain, we demonstrate how to identify the structural ‘fingerprints’ of existing successful and unsuccessful DBS targets in terms of their connectivity to other brain regions, as defined by the whole-brain anatomical parcellation. Second, we use a number of different strategies to identify the successful fingerprints of structural connectivity across four patients with successful outcomes compared with two patients with unsuccessful outcomes. This fingerprinting method can potentially be used pre-surgically to account for a patient’s individual connectivity and identify the best DBS target. Ultimately, our novel fingerprinting method could be combined with advanced whole-brain computational modelling of the spontaneous dynamics arising from the structural changes in disease, to provide new insights and potentially new targets for hitherto impenetrable neuropsychiatric disorders."

These patterns are not static, but exhibit complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Over the last years, a multitude of methods have been proposed to reveal these dynamics on the level of the whole brain. One finding is that the brain transitions through different FC configurations over time, and substantial effort has been put into characterizing these configurations. However, the dynamics governing these transitions are more elusive, specifically, the contribution of stationary vs. non-stationary dynamics is an active field of inquiry. In this study, we use a whole-brain approach, considering FC dynamics between 66 ROIs covering the entire cortex. We combine an innovative dimensionality reduction technique, tensor decomposition, with a mean field model which possesses stationary dynamics. It has been shown to explain resting state FC averaged over time and multiple subjects, however, this average FC summarizes the spatial distribution of correlations while hiding their temporal dynamics. First, we apply tensor decomposition to resting state scans from 24 healthy controls in order to characterize spatio-temporal dynamics present in the data. We simultaneously utilize temporal and spatial information by creating tensors that are subsequently decomposed into sets of brain regions (“communities”) that share similar temporal dynamics, and their associated time courses. The tensors contain pairwise FC computed inside of overlapping sliding windows. Communities are discovered by clustering features pooled from all subjects, thereby ensuring that they generalize. We find that, on the group level, the data give rise to four distinct communities that resemble known resting state networks (RSNs): default mode network, visual network, control networks, and somatomotor network. Second, we simulate data with our stationary mean field model whose nodes are connected according to results from DTI and fiber tracking. In this model, all spatio-temporal structure is due to noisy fluctuations around the average FC. We analyze the simulated data in the same way as the empirical data in order to determine whether stationary dynamics can explain the emergence of distinct FC patterns (RSNs) which have their own time courses. We find that this is the case for all four networks using the spatio-temporal information revealed by tensor decomposition if nodes in the simulation are connected according to model-based effective connectivity. Furthermore, we find that these results require only a small part of the FC values, namely the highest values that occur across time and ROI pair. Our findings show that stationary dynamics can account for the emergence of RSNs. We provide an innovative method that does not make strong assumptions about the underlying data and is generally applicable to resting state or task data from different subject populations."

Based on those and further principles of cortical computation, hypotheses are explored in which syntax is encoded in the cortex using sparse distributed place coding. Each cortical module 2–3 mm in diameter is proposed to be formed of a local attractor neuronal network with a capacity in the order of 10,000 words (e.g. subjects, verbs or objects depending on the module). Such a system may form a deep language-of-thought layer. For the information to be communicated to other people, the modules in which the neurons are firing which encode the syntactic role, as well as which neurons are firing to specify the words, must be communicated. It is proposed that one solution to this (used in English) is temporal order encoding, for example subject–verb–object. It is shown with integrate-and-fire simulations that this order encoding could be implemented by weakly forward-coupled subject–verb–object modules. A related system can decode a temporal sequence. This approach based on known principles of cortical computation needs to be extended to investigate further whether it could form a biological foundation for the implementation of language in the brain.

To investigate the role of noise in a multistable neurodynamical system described by coupled differential equations, one usually considers numerical simulations, which are time consuming because of the need for sufficiently many trials to capture the statistics of the influence of the fluctuations on that system. An alternative analytical approach involves the derivation of deterministic differential equations for the moments of the distribution of the activity of the neuronal populations. However, the application of the method of moments is restricted by the assumption that the distribution of the state variables of the system takes on a unimodal Gaussian shape. We extend in this paper the classical moments method to the case of bimodal distribution of the state variables, such that a reduced system of deterministic coupled differential equations can be derived for the desired regime of multistability."

Watson and Humphreys [Watson, D., Humphreys, G.W., 1997. Visual marking: prioritizing selection for new objects by top–down attentional inhibition of old objects. Psychological Review 104, 90–122] presented evidence that new information in search tasks is prioritised by (amongst other processes) active ignoring of old items – a process they termed visual marking. In this paper we present, for the first time, an explicit computational model of visual marking using biologically plausible activation functions. The “spiking search over time and space” model (sSoTS) incorporates different synaptic components (NMDA, AMPA, GABA) and a frequency adaptation mechanism based on [Ca 2+ ] sensitive K + current. This frequency adaptation current can act as a mechanism that suppresses the previously attended items. We show that, when coupled with a process of active inhibition applied to old items, frequency adaptation leads to old items being de-prioritised (and new items prioritised) across time in search. Furthermore, the time course of these processes mimics the time course of the preview effect in human search. The results indicate that the sSoTS model can provide a biologically plausible account of human search over time as well as space."

Especially in the presence of noise which is mostly the case for real-world time series, the calculation of the information flow of the underlying system via the concept of symbolic dynamics is rather problematic since one has to use infinitesimal partitions. We circumvent this difficulty by measuring the information flow indirectly. More precisely, we calculate a measure based on higher order cumulants which quantifies the statistical dependencies between the past values of the time series and the point r steps ahead. As an extension of Theiler's method of surrogate data (Theiler et al., 1992) this cumulant based information flow (a function of the look-ahead r ) is used as the discriminating statistic in testing the observed dynamics against a hierarchy of null hypotheses corresponding to nonlinear Markov processes of increasing order. This procedure is iterative in the sense that whenever a null hypothesis is rejected new data sets can be generated corresponding to better approximations of the original process in terms of information flow. Since we use higher order cumulants for calculating the discriminating statistic our method is also applicable to small data sets. Numerical results on artificial and real-world examples including non-chaotic, nonlinear processes, autoregressive models and noisy chaos show the effectiveness of our approach."

Experimental evidence suggests distinct processing modes depending on the type of task the visual system is engaged in. A first mode deals with rapidly extracting the glimpse of a visual scene in the first 100ms after its presentation. The promptness of this process points to mainly feedforward processing, which may be shaped by Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity. Our simulations confirm the plausibility and efficiency of such a scheme. A second mode can be engaged whenever one needs to perform finer perceptual discrimination through evidence accumulation. Here, our simulations, together with theoretical considerations, show how predominantly local recurrent connections and long neural time-constants enable the integration and build-up of firing rates on this timescale. A third mode, involving additional top-down attentional signals, is relevant for more complex visual scene processing. In the model, as in the brain, these top-down attentional signals shape visual processing by biasing the competition between different neuron pools. The winning pools may not only have a higher firing rate, but also more synchronous oscillatory activity. This fourth mode, oscillatory activity, leads to faster reaction times and enhanced information transfers in the model. This has indeed been observed experimentally. Moreover, oscillatory activity can encode information in the spike phases with respect to the oscillatory cycle. This phenomenon is referred to as “Phase-of-Firing Coding”, and experimental evidence for it is accumulating in the visual system. Simulations show that this code can again be efficiently decoded by STDP. Future work should focus on continuous natural vision, bio-inspired hardware vision systems, and novel experimental paradigms to further distinguish current modeling approaches."

First, the genetic or environmental roots of this putative association have not been elicited. Secondly, while different mathematical representations of resting-state fMRI patterns can embed diverse information of relevance for health and disease, many of them have not been studied in detail regarding the cerebellum and depression. Here, high-resolution fMRI scans were examined to estimate functional connectivity patterns across twenty-six cerebellar regions in a sample of 48 identical twins (24 pairs) informative for depression liability. A network-based statistic approach was employed to analyze cerebellar functional networks built using three methods: the conventional approach of filtered BOLD fMRI time-series, and two analytic components of this oscillatory activity (amplitude envelope and instantaneous phase). The findings indicate that some environmental factors may lead to depression vulnerability through alterations of the neural oscillatory activity of the cerebellum during resting-state. These effects may be observed particularly when exploring the amplitude envelope of fMRI oscillations."

In our modeling study, we sought to integrate several hypotheses on the function of the prefrontal cortex using a computational model, and compare the results to experimental data. We constructed a module of prefrontal cortex neurons exposed to two different inputs, which we envision to originate from the inferotemporal cortex and the basal ganglia. We found that working memory properties do not describe the dominant dynamics in the prefrontal cortex, but the activation seems to be transient, probably progressing along a pathway from sensory to motor areas. During the presentation of the cue, the dynamics of the prefrontal cortex is bistable, yielding a distinct activation for correct and error trails. We find that a linear change in network parameters relates to the changes in neural activity in consecutive correct trials during learning, which is important evidence for the underlying learning mechanisms."

Neurons in higher order areas 21 and 19 compute object motion under such conditions and send feedback to early visual areas 18 and 17, which is instrumental in eliciting computation of motion in those very areas. To explore the computational dynamics of AM, we made a neural field model consisting of two one-dimensional rings of simple neurons expressing firing rates, one for areas 17/18 and one for areas 19/21. The model neurons, without any orientation or direction selectivity, computed apparent motion for the range of space-timings of stimuli associated with short- and long-range AM in humans. The computation of long-range AM in 17/18 required two model areas and the presence of feedback and conduction/computation delays between those areas. As in the in vivo experiments of long-range AM, the stationary stimuli were initially mapped as stationary in model area 17/18, but after the feedback also these lower areas computed AM. The dynamics of the two-area network produces short-range and long-range apparent motion for a large range of feedback strengths and a small range of lateral excitation near the bifurcation to an amplitude instability. The computation of AM in higher order areas was due to the neurons in these areas having large receptive fields as a consequence of divergent feed-forward connectivity. This implies that these areas compute long-range AM when early areas 17 and 18 do not, and therefore higher order areas must enslave lower order areas to compute the same, if the whole network is to arrive at a coherent perceptual solution."

This resource-allocating network (RAN) allocates a new neuron whenever an unknown pattern is presented at its input layer. In this paper we introduce a new network architecture and learning paradigm. The aim of our approach is to incorporate ""coarse coding"" to the resource-allocating network. The network presented here provides for each input coordinate a separate layer, which consists of one-dimensional, locally tuned gaussian neurons. In the following layer multidimensional receptive fields are built by using pi-neurons. Linear neurons aggregate the outputs of the pi-neurons in order to approximate the required input-output mapping. The learning process follows the ideas of the resource-allocating network of Platt but due to the extended architecture of our network other improvements of the learning process had to be defined. Compared to the resource-allocating network a more compact network with comparable accuracy is obtained."

A dominant explanation for this is that brain regions from the contralesional hemisphere “take over” their functions, whereas the damaged areas and other ipsilesional regions play much less of a role. However, it is difficult to tease apart whether changes in neural activity after early brain injury are due to damage caused by the lesion or by processes related to postinjury reorganization. We sought to differentiate between these two causes by investigating the functional connectivity (FC) of brain areas during the resting state in human children with early brain injury using a computational model. We simulated a large-scale network consisting of realistic models of local brain areas coupled through anatomical connectivity information of healthy and injured participants. We then compared the resulting simulated FC values of healthy and injured participants with the empirical ones. We found that the empirical connectivity values, especially of the damaged areas, correlated better with simulated values of a healthy brain than those of an injured brain. This result indicates that the structural damage caused by an early brain injury is unlikely to have an adverse and sustained impact on the functional connections, albeit during the resting state, of damaged areas. Therefore, these areas could continue to play a role in the development of near-normal function in certain domains such as language in these children."

The firing rate probability distribution of each neuron to a set of stimuli is often exponential or gamma. In processes in the brain, such as decision-making, that are influenced by the noise produced by the close to random spike timings of each neuron for a given mean rate, the noise with this graded type of representation may be larger than with the binary firing rate distribution that is usually investigated. In integrate-and-fire simulations of an attractor decision-making network, we show that the noise is indeed greater for a given sparseness of the representation for graded, exponential, than for binary firing rate distributions. The greater noise was measured by faster escaping times from the spontaneous firing rate state when the decision cues are applied, and this corresponds to faster decision or reaction times. The greater noise was also evident as less stability of the spontaneous firing state before the decision cues are applied. The implication is that spiking-related noise will continue to be a factor that influences processes such as decision-making, signal detection, short-term memory, and memory recall even with the quite large networks found in the cerebral cortex. In these networks there are several thousand recurrent collateral synapses onto each neuron. The greater noise with graded firing rate distributions has the advantage that it can increase the speed of operation of cortical circuitry."

Specifically, we use a unique neuroimaging dataset of human sleep to systematically investigate where to stimulate the brain to force an awakening of the human sleeping brain and vice versa. We show where this is possible using a definition of a brain state as an ensemble of “metastable substates,” each with a probabilistic stability and occurrence frequency fitted by a generative whole-brain model, fine-tuned on the basis of the effective connectivity. Given the biophysical limitations of direct electrical stimulation (DES) of microcircuits, this opens exciting possibilities for discovering stimulation targets and selecting connectivity patterns that can ensure propagation of DES-induced neural excitation, potentially making it possible to create awakenings from complex cases of brain injury."

In particular, the phases of oscillatory LFP's allow studying the coordination of neural oscillations in time and space and to tie it to cognitive processing. Given the computational roles of LFP phases, it is important to know how they relate to the phases of the underlying current source densities (CSD's) that generate them. Although CSD's and LFP's are distinct physical quantities, they are often (implicitly) identified when interpreting experimental observations.That this identification is problematic is clear from the fact that LFP phases change when switching to different electrode montages, while the underlying CSD phases remain unchanged. In this study we use a volume-conductor model to characterize discrepancies between LFP and CSD phase-patterns, to identify the contributing factors, and to assess the effect of different electrode montages. Although we focus on cortical LFP's recorded with two-dimensional (Utah) arrays, our findings are also relevant for other electrode configurations. We found that the main factors that determine the discrepancy between CSD and LFP phase-patterns are the frequency of the neural oscillations and the extent to which the laminar CSD profile is balanced. Furthermore, the presence of laminar phase-differences in cortical oscillations, as commonly observed in experiments, precludes identifying LFP phases with those of the oscillations at a given cortical depth. This observation potentially complicates the interpretation of spike-LFP coherence and spike-triggered CSD averages. With respect to reference strategies, we found that the average-reference montage leads to larger discrepancies between LFP and CSD phases as compared with the referential montage, while the Laplacian montage reduces these discrepancies."

We show that a network of biological realistic integrate-and-fire excitatory and inhibitory neurons, implementing the mechanisms of local or modular biased-competition, which is transmitted through cooperation to different subsets of neuronal pools, can explain the formation of selective context-dependent working memory. The modes of operation of the network are characterized and the corresponding parameter settings revealed. Modular competition and cooperation might constitute general mechanisms for implementing context-dependent formation of working memory."

We explicitly model the feed-forward (bottom-up) and feedback (top-down) interactions between posterior brain areas (V1; V2; V4, inferior temporal cortex, (IT); and parietal cortex, (PP) and anterior (prefrontal cortex, (PFC)) brain areas. We assume that top-down processes operate using biased competition to implement attentional effects in earlier cortical processing areas. The computational model shows how attentional effects important in, for example, visual search may be implemented in the brain, shows that some serial attentional effects can be accounted for by different difficulties of constraint satisfaction in a purely parallel dynamical system, and makes predictions at the single-neuron, fMRI, and brain-lesion levels of investigation."

This criterion can be viewed as a first principle that demonstrates the experimentally observed fact that cortical neurons display synchronous firing for some stimuli and not for others. The principle can be regarded as the postulation of a nonparametric reconstruction method as optimization criteria for learning the required functional connectivity that justifies and explains synchronous firing for binding of features as a mechanism for spatiotemporal coding. This can be expressed in an information-theoretic way by maximizing the discrimination ability between different sensory inputs in minimal time.

The discrimination ability is measured by the second-order Renyi mutual information between the random variable describing the name of the signal and a sequence of n output spikes. Analysing this measure as a function of n, we study the coding strategy of a single spiking neuron, with the following main results. A small number of output spikes is required for efficient discrimination of input signals, i.e. for encoding them, if the separation is easy; a large number of output spikes is required in the difficult case of separation of very similar input signals. Three different versions of the spike response model of a single neuron are studied. The approach presented can be regarded as a non-parametric version of the reconstruction method of Bialek."

A more detailed analysis of modeling chaotic systems involves the calculation of the dynamical invariants which characterize a chaotic attractor. The features of the chaotic attractor are captured during learning only if the neural network learns the dynamical invariants. The two most important of these are the largest Lyapunov exponent which contains information on how far in the future predictions are possible, and the Correlation or Fractal Dimension which indicates how complex the dynamical system is. An additional useful quantity is the power spectrum of a time series which characterizes the dynamics of the system as well, and this in a more thorough form than the prediction error does."

However, the behavioral changes observed after deep brain stimulation (DBS) suggest the existence of such Hebbian-like mechanisms occurring at the structural level with functional consequences. In this rare case study, we obtained the full network of white matter connections of one patient with Parkinson’s disease (PD) before and after long-term DBS and combined it with a computational model of ongoing activity to investigate the effects of DBS-induced long-term structural changes. The results show that the long-term effects of DBS on resting-state functional connectivity is best obtained in the computational model by changing the structural weights from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) to the putamen and the thalamus in a Hebbian-like manner. Moreover, long-term DBS also significantly changed the SC towards normality in terms of model-based measures of segregation and integration of information processing, two key concepts of brain organization. This novel approach using computational models to model the effects of Hebbian-like changes in SC allowed us to causally identify the possible underlying neural mechanisms of long-term DBS using rare case study data. In time, this could help predict the efficacy of individual DBS targeting and identify novel DBS targets."

The human lateral orbitofrontal cortex is activated when non-reward, or loss occurs. The neuronal computation of this negative reward prediction error is fundamental for the emotional changes associated with non-reward, and with changing behaviour. Little is known about the neuronal mechanism. Here we propose a mechanism, which we formalize into a neuronal network model, which is simulated to enable the operation of the mechanism to be investigated. A single attractor network has a reward population (or pool) of neurons that is activated by expected reward, and maintain their firing until, after a time, synaptic depression reduces the firing rate in this neuronal population. If a reward outcome is not received, the decreasing firing in the reward neurons releases the inhibition implemented by inhibitory neurons, and this results in a second population of non-reward neurons to start and continue firing encouraged by the spiking-related noise in the network. If a reward outcome is received, this keeps the reward attractor active, and this through the inhibitory neurons prevents the non-reward attractor neurons from being activated. If an expected reward has been signalled, and the reward attractor neurons are active, their firing can be directly inhibited by a non-reward outcome, and the non-reward neurons become activated because the inhibition on them is released. The neuronal mechanisms in the orbitofrontal cortex for computing negative reward prediction error are important, for this system may be over-reactive in depression, under-reactive in impulsive behaviour, and may influence the dopaminergic ‘prediction error’ neurons."

A component of major importance in these tasks is referred to as the “attentional control” thought to be implemented by the prefrontal cortex which acts primarily by an amplification of task relevant information. This mode of operation is illustrated by a neurodynamical model developed for a new kind of set shifting experiment: The Wisconsin-Delayed-Match-to-Sample task combines uninstructed shifts as investigated in Wisconsin-like tasks with a Delayed-Match-to-Sample paradigm. These newly developed WDMS experiments in conjunction with the neurodynamical simulations are able to explain the reason for decreased attention in set shifting experiments as well the different consequences of decreased attention in tasks requiring bivalent yes/no responses compared to tasks requiring multivalent responses.

Computational modeling has revealed itself as a valuable asset to address some of the fundamental questions. Biophysically plausible models, in particular, are useful in bridging the different levels of description that experimental studies provide, from the neural spiking activity recorded at the cellular level to the performance reported at the behavioral level. In this article, we have reviewed some of the recent progress made in the understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie decision making. We have performed a critical evaluation of the available results and address, from a computational perspective, aspects of both experimentation and modeling that so far have eluded comprehension. To guide the discussion, we have selected a central theme which revolves around the following question: how does the spatiotemporal structure of sensory stimuli affect the perceptual decision-making process? This question is a timely one as several issues that still remain unresolved stem from this central theme. These include: (i) the role of spatiotemporal input fluctuations in perceptual decision making, (ii) how to extend the current results and models derived from two-alternative choice studies to scenarios with multiple competing evidences, and (iii) to establish whether different types of spatiotemporal input fluctuations affect decision-making outcomes in distinctive ways. And although we have restricted our discussion mostly to visual decisions, our main conclusions are arguably generalizable; hence, their possible extension to other sensory modalities is one of the points in our discussion."

Recent experimental evidence further suggests that the adverse effect of lesions is visible on spontaneous dynamics characterized by changes in resting state functional connectivity and its graph theoretical properties (e.g. modularity). These changes originate from altered neural dynamics in individual brain areas that are otherwise poised towards a homeostatic equilibrium to maintain a stable excitatory and inhibitory activity. In this work, we employ a homeostatic inhibitory mechanism, balancing excitation and inhibition in the local brain areas of the entire cortex under neurological impairments like lesions to understand global functional recovery (across brain networks and individuals). Previous computational and empirical studies have demonstrated that the resting state functional connectivity varies primarily due to the location and specific topological characteristics of the lesion. We show that local homeostatic balance provides a functional recovery by re-establishing excitation–inhibition balance in all areas that are affected by lesion. We systematically compare the extent of recovery in the primary hub areas (e.g. default mode network (DMN), medial temporal lobe, medial prefrontal cortex) as well as other sensory areas like primary motor area, supplementary motor area, fronto-parietal and temporo-parietal networks. Our findings suggest that stability and richness similar to the normal brain dynamics at rest are achievable by re-establishment of balance."

Simulations with this model resulted in specific predictions that were confirmed with a novel visual-search experiment utilising hierarchical patterns.

Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated systematic relationships between resting-state and task-induced functional connectivity (FC). In particular, continuous task studies, such as movie watching, speak to alterations in coupling among cortical regions and enhanced fluctuations in FC compared to the resting-state. This suggests that FC may reflect systematic and large-scale reorganization of functionally integrated responses while subjects are watching movies. In this study, we characterized fluctuations in FC during resting-state and movie-watching conditions. We found that the FC patterns induced systematically by movie-watching can be explained with a single principal component. These condition-specific FC fluctuations overlapped with inter-subject synchronization patterns in occipital and temporal brain regions. However, unlike inter-subject synchronization, condition-specific FC patterns were characterized by increased correlations within frontal brain regions and reduced correlations between frontal-parietal brain regions. We investigated these condition-specific functional variations as a shorter time scale, using time-resolved FC. The time-resolved FC showed condition-specificity over time; notably when subjects watched both the same and different movies. To explain self-organisation of global FC through the alterations in local dynamics, we used a large-scale computational model. We found that condition-specific reorganization of FC could be explained by local changes that engendered changes in FC among higher-order association regions, mainly in frontal and parietal cortices."

The temporal changes of the amplitude comprise slow, persistent memory processes, whereas phase synchronization exhibits less temporally structured and more complex correlations, indicating a fast and flexible coding. This distinct temporal scaling supports the idea of different roles of amplitude and phase fluctuations in cortical functioning."

Many authors now claim that early, sensory-based cross-modal convergence improves performance in detection tasks. An important strand of supporting evidence for this claim is based on statistical models such as the Pythagorean model or the probabilistic summation model. These models establish statistical benchmarks representing the best predicted performance under the assumption that there are no interactions between the two sensory paths. Following this logic, when observed detection performances surpass the predictions of these models, it is often inferred that such improvement indicates cross-modal convergence. We present a theoretical analyses scrutinizing some of these models and the statistical criteria most frequently used to infer early cross-modal interactions during detection tasks. Our current analysis shows how some common misinterpretations of these models lead to their inadequate use and, in turn, to contradictory results and misleading conclusions. To further illustrate the latter point, we introduce a model that accounts for detection performances in multimodal detection tasks but for which surpassing of the Pythagorean or probabilistic summation benchmark can be explained without resorting to early cross-modal interactions.

First, we derive a statistical-mechanics-based model of unsupervised learning defined by redundancy reduction between the output components of neural nets and entropy conservation from inputs to outputs. We obtain an approximate expression for the probability distribution of the output components for a new data point, which is essentially determined by the probability distribution given by the best network of neural ensembles and by the square root of the ratio between the determinants of the Fisher information without and with the new point. Second, we pose the problem of supervised learning as an unsupervised one. The ensemble theory derived for unsupervised learning results in one for supervised learning by using the ensemble theory based on the maximum-likelihood principle. An upper bound for the prediction probability of a new point not included in the training data is derived. This upper bound is essentially given by the ratio between the Fisher information, determined for the training sets without and with the inclusion of the new point. This upper bound may be used as a mechanism to decide actively on the novelty of new data (mechanism of query learning). An illustrative example is given for the case where the training error possesses a Gaussian distribution. (c) 1995 The American Physical Society"

Our network is an extension of Wang's [2] binary decision-making model, which is based on attractor dynamics and winner-take-all competition of two selective populations of neurons (pools), each representing one choice alternative.

Here, we provide crossvalidated evidence that such changes are initiated by an alteration of physiological network state dynamics. Specifically, our analysis of long intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from a group of 10 patients identifies a critical phase of a few hours in which time-dependent network states become less variable (""degenerate""), and this phase is followed by a global functional connectivity reduction before seizure onset. This critical phase is characterized by an abnormal occurrence of highly correlated network instances and is shown to be particularly associated with the activity of the resected regions in patients with validated postsurgical outcome. Our approach characterizes preseizure network dynamics as a cascade of 2 sequential events providing new insights into seizure prediction and control."

These “resting state networks” (RSNs) fluctuate over time, forming and dissolving on the scale of seconds to minutes. While these fluctuations, most prominently those of the default mode network, have been linked to cognitive function, it remains unclear whether they result from random noise or whether they index a nonstationary process which could be described as state switching. In this study, we use a sliding windows-approach to relate temporal dynamics of RSNs to global modulations in correlation and BOLD variance. We compare empirical data, phase-randomized surrogate data, and data simulated with a stationary model. We find that RSN time courses exhibit a large amount of coactivation in all three cases, and that the modulations in their activity are closely linked to global dynamics of the underlying BOLD signal. We find that many properties of the observed fluctuations in FC and BOLD, including their ranges and their correlations amongst each other, are explained by fluctuations around the average FC structure. However, we also report some interesting characteristics that clearly support nonstationary features in the data. In particular, we find that the brain spends more time in the troughs of modulations than can be expected from stationary dynamics."

We demonstrate that under the constraint of bounded and invertible output transfer functions the two main goals of unsupervised learning, redundancy reduction and maximization of the transmitted information between input and output (Infomax-principle), are equivalent. No assumptions are made concerning the kind of input and output distributions, i.e. the kind of nonlinearity of correlations. An adapted version of the general NICA network is used for the modeling of multivariate time series by unsupervised learning. Given time series of various observables of a dynamical system, our net learns their evolution in time by extracting statistical dependencies between past and present elements of the time series. Multivariate modeling is obtained by making present value of each time series statistically independent not only from their own past but also from the past of the other series. Therefore, in contrast to univariate methods, the information lying in the couplings between the observables is also used and a detection of higher-order cross correlations is possible. We apply our method to time series of the two-dimensional Henon map and to experimental time series obtained from the measurements of axial velocities in different locations in weakly turbulent Taylor-Couette flow."

Knowing that FC constantly evolves over time, it becomes important to assess how FC dynamically differs in remitted-MDD patients vulnerable for new depressive episodes. Using a recently developed method to examine dynamic FC, we characterized re-emerging FC states during rest in 51 antidepressant-free MDD patients at high risk of recurrence (≥2 previous episodes), and 35 healthy controls. We examined differences in occurrence, duration, and switching profiles of FC states after neutral and sad mood induction. Remitted MDD patients showed a decreased probability of an FC state (p < 0.005) consisting of an extensive network connecting frontal areas—important for cognitive control—with default mode network, striatum, and salience areas, involved in emotional and self-referential processing. Even when this FC state was observed in patients, it lasted shorter (p < 0.005) and was less likely to switch to a smaller prefrontal–striatum network (p < 0.005). Differences between patients and controls decreased after sad mood induction. Further, the duration of this FC state increased in remitted patients after sad mood induction but not in controls (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest reduced ability of remitted-MDD patients, in neutral mood, to access a clinically relevant control network involved in the interplay between externally and internally oriented attention. When recovering from sad mood, remitted recurrent MDD appears to employ a compensatory mechanism to access this FC state. This study provides a novel neurobiological profile of MDD vulnerability."

What is the source of this multistability in the content of perception? From a theoretical perspective, a fine balance between deterministic and stochastic forces has been suggested to underlie the spontaneous, intrinsically driven perceptual transitions observed during multistable perception. Deterministic forces are represented by adaptation of feature-selective neuronal populations encoding the competing percepts while stochastic forces are modeled as noise-driven processes. Here, we used a unified neuronal competition model to study the dynamics of adaptation and noise processes in binocular flash suppression (BFS), a form of externally induced perceptual suppression, and compare it with the dynamics of intrinsically driven alternations in binocular rivalry (BR). For the first time, we use electrophysiological, biologically relevant data to constrain a model of perceptual rivalry. Specifically, we show that the mean population discharge pattern of a perceptually modulated neuronal population detected in electrophysiological recordings in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) during BFS, constrains the dynamical range of externally induced perceptual transitions to a region around the bifurcation separating a noise-driven attractor regime from an adaptation-driven oscillatory regime. Most interestingly, the dynamical range of intrinsically driven perceptual transitions during BR is located in the noise-driven attractor regime, where it overlaps with BFS. Our results suggest that the neurodynamical mechanisms of externally induced and spontaneously generated perceptual alternations overlap in a narrow, noise-driven region just before a bifurcation where the system becomes adaptation-driven."

The present study characterizes how the brain's dynamical exploration of resting-state networks is rapidly modulated by intravenous infusion of psilocybin, a tryptamine psychedelic found in “magic mushrooms”. We employed a data-driven approach to characterize recurrent functional connectivity patterns by focusing on the leading eigenvector of BOLD phase coherence at single-TR resolution. Recurrent BOLD phase-locking patterns (PL states) were assessed and statistically compared pre- and post-infusion of psilocybin in terms of their probability of occurrence and transition profiles. Results were validated using a placebo session. Recurrent BOLD PL states revealed high spatial overlap with canonical resting-state networks. Notably, a PL state forming a frontoparietal subsystem was strongly destabilized after psilocybin injection, with a concomitant increase in the probability of occurrence of another PL state characterized by global BOLD phase coherence. These findings provide evidence of network-specific neuromodulation by psilocybin and represent one of the first attempts at bridging molecular pharmacodynamics and whole-brain network dynamics."

While resting state fMRI reveals networks at an ultraslow timescale (below 0.1 Hz), other neuroimaging modalities such as MEG and EEG suggest that much faster timescales may be equally or more relevant for discovering spatiotemporal structure. Here, we introduce a novel way to generate whole-brain neural dynamical activity at the millisecond scale from fMRI signals. This method allows us to study the different timescales through binning the output of the model. These timescales can then be investigated using a method (poetically named brain songs) to extract the spacetime motifs at a given timescale. Using independent measures of entropy and hierarchy to characterize the richness of the dynamical repertoire, we show that both methods find a similar optimum at a timescale of around 200 ms in resting state and in task data. An unresolved problem in neuroscience is to determine the relevant timescale for understanding spatiotemporal dynamics of the brain.

Exon 1D emerges as a suggestive new target in stress-related disorders epigenetically sensitive to early adversity. After assessment of 48 monozygotic twin pairs (n=96 subjects) informative for lifetime history of anxious-depressive disorders, they were classified as concordant, discordant or healthy in function of whether both, one or neither twin in each pair had a lifetime diagnosis of anxious-depressive disorders. DNA for epigenetic analysis was extracted from peripheral blood. Exon 1F and exon 1D CpG-specific methylation was analysed by means of pyrosequencing technology. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was available for 54 subjects (n=27 twin pairs). Exon 1D CpG-specific methylation within a glucocorticoid responsive element (GRE) was correlated with familial burden of anxious-depressive disorders (r=0.35, z=2.26, p=0.02).

Recent neurophysiological experiments have attempted to elucidate the neural correlates of metacognition in other species. Despite this increased attention, there is still no operational definition of metacognition and the ability of behavioral tasks to reflect metacognition is the subject of debate. The most widely used task for studying metacognition in animals, the uncertain-option task, has been criticized because it can be solved by simple associative mechanisms. Here we propose a broad perspective that generalizes those critiques to another task, post-decision wagering. Moreover, we extend this critical view to account for recent neurophysiological evidence. We argue these tasks are simple enough that any animal could solve them using very simple mechanisms such as sensory-motor associations. In this case, it is impossible to know whether all animals are metacognitive, or if the tasks are simply not appropriate. Therefore, we suggest using better defined concepts until a suitable task for metacognition is available."

Further evaluation of the models show how balancing excitation with feedback inhibition generates an inverse relationship between α-rhythms and population firing on a faster time scale and resting-state network oscillations on a slower time scale. Lastly, large-scale interactions in the model lead to the emergence of scale-free power-law spectra. Our novel findings underscore the integrative role for computational modelling to complement empirical studies."

While both depression and resting-state brain activity are shaped by genes and environment, the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors mediating the relationship between amygdalar resting-state connectivity and depression remain largely unexplored. Likewise, novel neuroimaging research indicates that different mathematical representations of resting-state fMRI activity patterns are able to embed distinct information relevant to brain health and disease. The present study analyzed the influence of genes and environment on amygdalar resting-state fMRI connectivity, in relation to depression risk. High-resolution resting-state fMRI scans were analyzed to estimate functional connectivity patterns in a sample of 48 twins (24 monozygotic pairs) informative for depressive psychopathology (6 concordant, 8 discordant and 10 healthy control pairs). A graph-theoretical framework was employed to construct brain networks using two methods: (i) the conventional approach of filtered BOLD fMRI time-series and (ii) analytic components of this fMRI activity. Results using both methods indicate that depression risk is increased by environmental factors altering amygdalar connectivity. When analyzing the analytic components of the BOLD fMRI time-series, genetic factors altering the amygdala neural activity at rest show an important contribution to depression risk. Overall, these findings show that both genes and environment modify different patterns the amygdala resting-state connectivity to increase depression risk. The genetic relationship between amygdalar connectivity and depression may be better elicited by examining analytic components of the brain resting-state BOLD fMRI signals.

[The influence of initial exposure on lexical representation: Comparing early and simultaneous bilinguals. Journal of Memory and Language, 52, 240--255, 2005] contrasted highly proficient early Spanish-Catalan and Catalan-Spanish bilinguals, using Catalan materials in a lexical decision task (LDT). They constructed two types of experimental pseudowords, substituting Catalan phoneme /e/ for Catalan /e/, or vice versa. Catalan-dominant bilinguals showed a performance asymmetry across experimental conditions, making more mistakes for /e/→/e/ changes, than for /e/→/e/ ones. This was considered evidence of a developed acceptance of mispronounced Catalan /e/-words, caused by exposure to a bilingual environment where mispronunciations by Spanish-dominant bilinguals using their /e/-category abound. Although this indicated modified or added lexical representations, an open issue is whether such lexical information also modifies phoneme categories. We address this using a biophysically realistic neurodynamic model, describing neural activity at the synaptic and spiking levels. We construct a network of pools of neurons, representing phonemic and lexical processing. Carefully analyzing the dependency of network dynamics on connection strengths, by first exploring parameter space under steady-state assumptions (mean-field scans), then running spiking simulations, we investigate the neural substrate role in a representative LDT. We also simulate a phoneme discrimination task to address whether lexical changes affect the phonemic level. We find that the same network configuration which displays asymmetry in the LDT shows equal performance discriminating the two modeled phonemes. Thus, we predicted that the Catalan-dominant bilinguals do not alter their phoneme categories, although showing signs of having stored a new word variation in the lexicon. To explore this prediction, a syllable discrimination task involving the /e/-/e/ contrast was set up, using Catalan-dominants displaying performance asymmetry in a repetition of the original LDT. Discrimination task results support the prediction, showing that these subjects discriminate both categories equally well. We conclude that subjects often exposed to dialectal word variations can store these in their lexicons, without altering their phoneme representations."

The information flow characterizes the loss of information about the initial conditions, i.e. the decay of statistical correlations (i.e. nonlinear and non-Gaussian) between the entire past and a point p steps into the future as a function of p. In the case where the partition generating the symbolic dynamics is finite, the information loss is measured by the mutual information that measures the statistical correlations between the entire past and a point p steps into the future. When the partition used is a generator and only one step ahead is observed (p = 1), our definition includes the Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy concept. The profiles in p of the mutual information describe the short- and long-range forecasting possibilities for the given partition resolution. For chaos it is more relevant to study the information loss for the case of infinitesimal partitions which characterizes the intrinsic behavior of the dynamics on an extremely fine scale. Due to the divergence of the mutual information for infinitesimal partitions, the ""intrinsic"" information flow is characterized by the conditional entropy which generalizes the Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy for the case of observing the uncertainty more than one step into the future. The intrinsic information flow offers an instrument for characterizing deterministic chaos by the transmission of information from the past to the future."

However, the neural mechanisms governing the entrainment of functionally specialized brain areas remain poorly understood. In particular, the question arises whether observed changes in the activity for different cognitive conditions are explained by modifications of the (intrinsic) inputs or (extrinsic) recurrent connectivity? Here, we show that fMRI transitions over successive time points - a new version of dynamic functional connectivity compared to usual definitions - convey information about the task performed by 19 subjects, namely watching a movie versus a black screen (rest). We use a theoretical framework that extracts this information to characterize the mechanisms underlying cortical coordination at the whole brain level. Our approach relies on our recent network model that was introduced for resting-state fMRI and estimates both the amplitude of input fluctuating activity to each of the 66 cortical regions and the strengths of cortico-cortical interactions between them. In our model, the change of condition does modify the (extrinsic) recurrent connectivity as much as the (intrinsic) inputs, which are putatively related to the movie stimulus. However, detailed changes in connectivity preserve a balance in the propagation of fluctuating activity and select specific pathways that integrate sensory information from the visual and auditory systems to high-level regions of the brain. These findings speak to a dynamic functional integration that underlies the hierarchical processing in the brain."

Methods We evaluated the consistency of two ictal spectral activation patterns (mean power change and power change onset time) in intracranial recordings across focal seizures from seven patients with clinically marked seizure onset zone (SOZ). We examined SOZ discrimination using both patterns in different frequency bands and periods of interest. Results Activation patterns were proved to be consistent across more than 80 % of recurrent ictal epochs. In all patients, whole-seizure mean activations were significantly higher for SOZ than non-SOZ regions ( P 0.05 ) while activation onset times were significantly lower for SOZ than for non-SOZ regions ( P 0.001 ) in six patients. Alpha-beta bands (8–20Hz) achieved the highest patient-average effect size on the whole-seizure period while gamma band (20–70Hz) achieved the highest discrimination values between SOZ and non-SOZ sites near seizure onset (0–5s). Conclusions Consistent spectral activation patterns in focal epilepsies discriminate the SOZ with high effect sizes upon appropriate selection of frequency bands and activation periods. Significance The present method may be used to improve epileptogenic identification as well as pinpoint additional regions that are functionally altered during ictal events."

We propose a multiple choice model implemented in a discrete attractors network.

When one neuron in one cortical area sends an action potential to target neurons in other cortical areas, this is a realization of a cortico-cortical communication. Sensory perception, thinking, and planning of a specific behavior, all rely on the evolution of cortico-cortical communications. The action potentials change the membrane potentials in the target neurons and, in turn, may excite these neurons to produce action potentials and complex patterns of excitation and inhibition in their targets. We launched the special research topic of cortico-cortical communication dynamics to invite contributions that would cast light on such evolution of spatio-temporal action potential and membrane potential dynamics in the cerebral cortex. The contributions were theoretical models, human EEG, and MEG data and data-driven models, and in vivo experimental data from animals accounting for specific aspects of cortico-cortical communication dynamics. In a recent in vitro experiment, Branco et al. (2010) show that single dendrites of pyramidal layer 2–3 neurons depolarize more and have larger Ca2+ influx when their depolarization progresses toward the soma, than when depolarization progresses away from the soma. Kiebel and Friston (2011) construct a (developmental) model of the pruning of single synapses and show that they can reproduce the findings of Branco et al. (2010) if the self-organizing pruning follows a Bayesian and information theory derived principle of minimization of free energy. Cortico-cortical communication dynamics can only be comprehensively studied in vivo. In vivo, the neurons and their dendrites are in a high conductance state (Destexhe et al., 2003), and the propagation of depolarizations to the soma and action potential generation may thus be difficult to predict (Williams and Mitchell, 2008). This does not exclude, however, that the model of Kiebel and Friston (2011) may be appropriate in early development and in the formation of cortio-cortical synapses. The pruning of synapses under development and hence the formation of the adult cortical network is the theme of the contribution of van den Bergh et al. (2012). Their model departs from a random network. This network is subsequently shaped by spontaneous ongoing spike activity. After a while the random structure disappears and many small-world sub-networks emerge. As van den Bergh et al. (2012) show, this only happens if the connectivity in the network is larger than a critical value. This is interesting as the developing brain has many cortico-cortical connections that disappear at later stages. As pointed out in a critical review of cortico-cortical communication dynamics, there are many obstacles precluding the tracing the ms by ms evolution of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the cortex (Roland et al., 2014). Therefore examination of the spatio-temporal dynamics in biologically plausible computational models of neurons may be one way to develop experimentally testable hypotheses. Li and Zhou (2011) made a computational model of neurons in two inter-connected cortical areas. The duration of the delays in communication and the distribution of inhibition in the local network determined whether the neurons would spike in phase or in anti-phase and whether interactions between slow and fast membrane oscillations would produce anti-phase spiking. These findings are pertinent for the hypothesis on cortico-cortical communication through coherence (Fries, 2009). Facing the obstacles of tracing the spatio-temporal dynamics of cortico-cortical communications at the cellular scale, many scientists choose to study membrane electrical activity at the scale of large neuron populations, and from EEG and MEG signals try to infer putative routes of communication. Banerjee et al. (2012) discuss these methods and point out that there is no consensus as to what constitutes a large-scale network. Further, they show how MEG measurements may be interpreted by combining the empirical analysis with large-scale models of biologically realistic membrane activity. This is what is done in the contributions by Misic et al. (2011) and Vakorin et al. (2011). Their results show that time delays and the number of connections between sources, of MEG signals or EEG signals, contribute to the relation between variance in the signals and information transfer between the sources (Misic et al., 2011; Vakorin et al., 2011). At the mesoscopic scale one can observe changes in the membrane potentials with voltage sensitive dyes, local field potentials and combine this with recordings of action potentials from a few neurons or single neurons in experimental animals. Harvey and Roland (2013) demonstrate both forward spatiotemporal population membrane dynamics in higher visual areas that after 50 ms was followed by backward propagation of net-excitation from these areas in experiments with objects moving in the visual field. Vinnik et al. (2012) examined the communications from the auditory cortex to the hippocampus and show that the access to fire hippocampal neurons is state dependent. Sleep favors fast reactions of the hippocampal neurons to the extent as only seen for novel sounds in awake animals (Vinnik et al., 2012). Civillico and Contreras (2012) examined how the communication from the thalamus to the barrel cortex is affected by the state of the neurons in the barrel cortex. When the cortical neurons were in an up-state, the local field potentials, the membrane potential increases, and the multiunit activity evoked by a whisker stimulus was smaller than when the whisker stimulus was given just during the early transition from a down-state to an up-state (Civillico and Contreras, 2012). If one wants to understand how the cerebral cortex works one must be able to trace the evolution of the spatio-temporal transmission of action potentials and membrane conductances down to the cellular scale. As the critical review concludes, this is not possible yet. Assume that a full connectome of the mouse cerebral cortex exists (Bohland et al., 2009). This might help in finding the target neurons in other areas for a given neuron. However, it still remains to identify that source neuron spiking in an experiment and measure the membrane potential changes induced by that neuron on each of the target neurons, as each target neuron may have 1000 other source neurons. One may argue that if this multidimensional cellular dynamics should have any impact on perception and behavior, the dynamics of action potentials and membrane potential dynamics at more coarse scales should organize to make such impacts. The contributions to this special issue are fine examples of the many contemporary attempts to advance theoretical knowledge of cortico-cortical communication dynamics, provide testable hypotheses in this field, and test these hypotheses at the microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic scales."

The resting state patterns have been observed to be exhibiting complex spatio-temporal dynamics and substantial effort has been made to characterize the dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) configurations. However, the dynamics governing the state transitions that the brain undergoes and their relationship to stationary functional connectivity still remains an open problem. One class of approaches attempts to characterize the dynamics in terms of finite number of latent brain states, however, such attempts are yet to amalgamate the underlying anatomical structural connectivity (SC) with the dynamics. Another class of methods links individual dynamic FCs with the underlying SC but does not characterize the temporal evolution of FC. Further, the latent states discovered by previous approaches could not be directly linked to the SC, thereby motivating us to discover the underlying lower-dimensional manifold that represents the temporal structure. In the proposed approach, the discovered manifold is further parameterized as a set of local density distributions, or latent transient states. We propose an innovative method that learns parameters specific to the latent states using a graph-theoretic model (temporal Multiple Kernel Learning, tMKL) that inherently links dynamics to the structure and finally predicts the grand average FC of the test subjects by leveraging a state transition Markov model. The proposed solution does not make strong assumptions about the underlying data and is generally applicable to resting or task data for learning subject-specific state transitions and for successfully characterizing SC-dFC-FC relationship through a unifying framework. Training and testing were done using the rs-fMRI data of 46 healthy participants. tMKL model performs significantly better than the existing models for predicting resting state functional connectivity based on whole-brain dynamic mean-field model (DMF), single diffusion kernel (SDK) model and multiple kernel learning (MKL) model. Further, the learned model was tested on an independent cohort of 100 young, healthy participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the results establish the generalizability of the proposed solution. More importantly, the model retains sensitivity toward subject-specific anatomy, a unique contribution towards a holistic approach for SC-FC characterization."

It remains to be seen, however, if the propagation of BOLD activity can also relate to the brain anatomical structure at a more local scale. Here, we hypothesized that BOLD propagation reflect structured neural activity across early visual field maps. To explore this hypothesis, we characterize the propagation of BOLD activity across V1, V2 and V3 using a modeling approach that aims to disentangle the contributions of local activity and directed interactions in shaping BOLD propagation. It does so by estimating the effective connectivity (EC) and the excitability of a noise-diffusion network to reproduce the spatiotemporal covariance structure of the data. We apply our approach to 7T fMRI recordings acquired during resting state (RS) and visual field mapping (VFM). Our results reveal different EC interactions and changes in cortical excitability in RS and VFM, and point to a reconfiguration of feedforward and feedback interactions across the visual system. We conclude that the propagation of BOLD activity has functional relevance, as it reveals directed interactions and changes in cortical excitability in a state-dependent manner."

Although conceptually appealing, the network-theoretical approach to sensor-level EEG and MEG data is challenged by the fact that EEG and MEG time series are mixtures of source activity. It is, therefore, of interest to assess the relationship between functional networks of source activity and the ensuing sensor-level networks. Since these topological features are of high interest in experimental studies, we address the question of to what extent the network topology can be reconstructed from sensor-level functional connectivity (FC) measures in case of MEG data. Simple simulations that consider only a small number of regions do not allow to assess network properties; therefore, we use a diffusion magnetic resonance imaging-constrained whole-brain computational model of resting-state activity. Our motivation lies behind the fact that still many contributions found in the literature perform network analysis at sensor level, and we aim at showing the discrepancies between source- and sensor-level network topologies by using realistic simulations of resting-state cortical activity. Our main findings are that the effect of field spread on network topology depends on the type of interaction (instantaneous or lagged) and leads to an underestimation of lagged FC at sensor level due to instantaneous mixing of cortical signals, instantaneous interaction is more sensitive to field spread than lagged interaction, and discrepancies are reduced when using planar gradiometers rather than axial gradiometers. We, therefore, recommend using lagged interaction measures on planar gradiometer data when investigating network properties of resting-state sensor-level MEG data."

Structural connectivity (SC) captures the anatomical pathways across the brain and functional connectivity (FC) measures the correlation between the activity of brain regions. These connectivity measures have been much studied using network theory in order to uncover the distributed organization of brain structures, in particular FC for task-specific brain communication. However, the application of network theory to study FC matrices is often “static” despite the dynamic nature of time series obtained from fMRI. The present study aims to overcome this limitation by introducing a network-oriented analysis applied to whole-brain effective connectivity (EC) useful to interpret the brain dynamics. Technically, we tune a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (MOU) process to reproduce the statistics of the whole-brain resting-state fMRI signals, which provides estimates for MOU-EC as well as input properties (similar to local excitabilities). The network analysis is then based on the Green function (or network impulse response) that describes the interactions between nodes across time for the estimated dynamics. This model-based approach provides time-dependent graph-like descriptor, named communicability, that characterize the roles that either nodes or connections play in the propagation of activity within the network. They can be used at both global and local levels, and also enables the comparison of estimates from real data with surrogates (e.g. random network or ring lattice). In contrast to classical graph approaches to study SC or FC, our framework stresses the importance of taking the temporal aspect of fMRI signals into account. Our results show a merging of functional communities over time (in which input properties play a role), moving from segregated to global integration of the network activity. Our formalism sets a solid ground for the analysis and interpretation of fMRI data, including task-evoked activity."

The sensory stimuli are mapped through intermediate neurons responding to combinations of the sensory stimuli and the mapping required for motor responses, and the bias operates at the intermediate neuron level to switch the mapping. The mapping network consists of hierarchically organized sensory–intermediate–motor attractor pools of neurons. Each of the different global attractors of the whole mapping network corresponding to the different cue-response–context situations are composed of different and distributed single-pool attractors, and emerge from the cooperation and competition between the interacting single pools. The model is implemented using integrate-and-fire neurons to produce realistic spiking dynamics. The spiking in the model is similar to that of neurons recorded in the primate prefrontal cortex showing task-specific firing activity during working memory delay periods.

We demonstrate that it is plausible to build a neural system for visual search, which works across the visual field in parallel but due to the different intrinsic dynamics can show the two experimentally observed modes of visual attention, namely: the serial focal and the parallel spread over the space mode. In other words, neither explicit serial focal search nor saliencies maps should be assumed. The focus of attention is not included in the system but is a result of the convergence of the dynamic behavior of the neural networks. The dynamics of the system can be interpreted as an intrinsic dynamical routing for binding features if top–down information is available. The neural population dynamics are handled in the framework of the mean-field approximation. Consequently, the whole process can be expressed as a system of coupled differential equations."

The electrophysiological underpinnings of RSNs remain largely elusive and it has been shown only recently that electric cortical rhythms are organized into the same RSNs as hemodynamic signals. Most electrophysiological studies into RSNs use magnetoencephalography (MEG) or scalp electroencephalography (EEG), which limits the spatial resolution with which electrophysiological RSNs can be observed. Due to their close proximity to the cortical surface, electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings can potentially provide a more detailed picture of the functional organization of resting-state cortical rhythms, albeit at the expense of spatial coverage. In this study we propose using source-space spatial independent component analysis (spatial ICA) for identifying generators of resting-state cortical rhythms as recorded with ECoG and for reconstructing their functional connectivity. Network structure is assessed by two kinds of connectivity measures: instantaneous correlations between band-limited amplitude envelopes and oscillatory phase-locking. By simulating rhythmic cortical generators, we find that the reconstruction of oscillatory phase-locking is more challenging than that of amplitude correlations, particularly for low signal-to-noise levels. Specifically, phase-lags can both be over- and underestimated, which troubles the interpretation of lag-based connectivity measures. We illustrate the methodology on somatosensory beta rhythms recorded from a macaque monkey using ECoG. The methodology decomposes the resting-state sensorimotor network into three cortical generators, distributed across primary somatosensory and primary and higher-order motor areas. The generators display significant and reproducible amplitude correlations and phase-locking values with non-zero lags. Our findings illustrate the level of spatial detail attainable with source-projected ECoG and motivates wider use of the methodology for studying resting-state as well as event-related cortical dynamics in macaque and human."

The principles underlying this functional differentiation and integration remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that a fundamental principle ubiquitous in nature - harmonic modes - explains the orchestration of the brain9s functional organization. Applied to the functional connectivity in resting state averaged across 812 participants, harmonic modes give rise to functional harmonics revealing the communication channels of the human brain. Remarkably, the isolines of the continuous functional harmonic patterns (gradients) overlap with the borders of cortical areas. Furthermore, each associated with a different spatial frequency, the functional harmonics provide the frequency-ordered building blocks to reconstruct any pattern of brain activity. We show that 47 brain activation patterns elicited by 7 different task categories in the Human Connectome Project task battery can be reconstructed from a very small subset of functional harmonics, uncovering a parsimonious description of the previously unknown relationship between task and resting state brain activity. Crucially, functional harmonics outperform other well-known basis functions such as those used in principle component analysis (PCA) or independent component analysis (ICA) in both, reconstructing the task activation maps as well as explaining the emergence of functionally specialized regions. Thus, our findings not only unify two competing views of the brain9s functional organization, i.e. modular vs gradiental perspective, by revealing that the functional specialization of the human cortex occurs in a gradiental manner across multiple dimensions in the functional harmonic basis, but also evidence that this basis underlies task-elicited human brain function."

We illustrate this by deriving the phase dynamics of two seminal neural mass models: the Wilson-Cowan firing rate model and the voltage-based Freeman model. We established that the phase dynamics of these models differed qualitatively due to an attractive coupling in the first and a repulsive coupling in the latter. Using empirical structural connectivity matrices, we determined that the two dynamics cover the functional connectivity observed in resting state activity. We further searched for two pivotal dynamical features that have been reported in many experimental studies: (1) a partial phase synchrony with a possibility of a transition towards either a desynchronized or a (fully) synchronized state; (2) long-term autocorrelations indicative of a scale-free temporal dynamics of phase synchronization. Only the Freeman phase model exhibited scale-free behavior. Its repulsive coupling, however, let the individual phases disperse and does not allow for a transition into a synchronized state. The Wilson-Cowan phase model, by contrast, could switch into a (partially) synchronized state, but it did not generate long-term correlations although being located close to the onset of synchronization, i.e. in its critical regime. That is, the phase-reduced models can display one of the two dynamical features, but not both."

Moreover, we found another population of neurons that encodes the discriminability of the stimulus, thereby supplying another source of information about the difficulty of the decision. The activity of neurons encoding the difficulty can be produced by very different computations. Therefore, we show that decision difficulty can be encoded through three different mechanisms: 1. Switch time coding, 2. rate coding and 3. binary coding. This rich representation reflects the basis of different functional aspects of difficulty in the making of a decision and the possible role of difficulty estimation in complex decision scenarios."

Given the accumulating evidence that alpha oscillations play a fundamental role in attentional processing and working memory, it becomes increasingly important to characterize their cortical organization. Event-related studies have demonstrated that attentional allocation can modulate alpha power selectively within the visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices, as well as in higher-level regions. Such studies demonstrate the existence of multiple generators by exploiting experimental contrasts and trial-averaging. The identification of alpha generators from resting-state data alone has proven much harder and, consequently, relatively little is known about their organization: Apart from the classical visual, somatosensory, and auditory rhythms, it is unclear how many more generators can be observed with MEG and how they are organized into functional networks. Such knowledge, however, possibly enables to delineate separate cognitive, perceptual, and motor processes that co-occur in the resting-state and is therefore important. In this study we use the resting-state MEG data-set provided by the Human Connectome Project to identify cortical alpha generators and to characterize their organization into functional networks. The large number of subjects ( N = 94), multiple scans per subject, and state-of-the-art surface-based cortical registration enable a detailed characterization of alpha in human cortex. By applying non-negative matrix factorization to source-projected power fluctuations, we identify 16 reliable cortical generators in each hemisphere. These include the classical sensory alpha rhythms as well as several additional ones in the lateral occipital and temporal lobes and in inferior parietal cortex. We show that the generators are coordinated across hemispheres and hence form resting-state networks (RSNs), two of which are the default mode network (DMN) and the ventral attention network (VAN). Our study hence provides a further subdivision of RSNs within the alpha frequency band and shows that these RSNs are supported by alpha generators. As such, it links the classical literature on human alpha with more recent research into electrophysiological RNSs."

Reconstruction of the current source density (CSD) underlying such recordings, however, requires “inverting” Poisson’s equation. For inter-laminar recordings, this is commonly done by the CSD method, which consists in taking the second-order spatial derivative of the recorded local field potentials (LFPs). Although the CSD method has been tremendously successful in mapping the current generators underlying inter-laminar LFPs, its application to planar recordings is more challenging. While for inter-laminar recordings the CSD method seems reasonably robust against violations of its assumptions, is it unclear as to what extent this holds for planar recordings. One of the objectives of this study is to characterize the conditions under which the CSD method can be successfully applied to Utah array data. Using forward modeling, we find that for spatially coherent CSDs, the CSD method yields inaccurate reconstructions due to volume-conducted contamination from currents in deeper cortical layers. An alternative approach is to “invert” a constructed forward model. The advantage of this approach is that any a priori knowledge about the geometrical and electrical properties of the tissue can be taken into account. Although several inverse methods have been proposed for LFP data, the applicability of existing electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) inverse methods to LFP data is largely unexplored. Another objective of our study therefore, is to assess the applicability of the most commonly used EEG/MEG inverse methods to Utah array data. Our main conclusion is that these inverse methods provide more accurate CSD reconstructions than the CSD method.

A main limitation in this direction, as well as with fundamental studies of brain function, is the variability observed in fMRI data. In practice, such measurements exhibit a mixture of session-to-session variability with subject- and condition-related information. Disentangling these contributions is crucial for real-life applications where only a few sessions per subject are available. The present study aims to define a new reliable standard for the extraction of signatures from fMRI data. These signatures correspond to subnetworks of directed interactions between brain regions (typically 100 covering the whole brain) supporting the subject and condition identification for single fMRI sessions. The key is to step from functional connectivity to effective connectivity, which is estimated using a whole-brain dynamic model. Our method shows that as few as 4 sessions per subject are sufficient to perfectly identify more than 40 other sessions of 6 subjects. We also demonstrate the good generalization capability for 30 subjects. Using another dataset with resting state and movie viewing, we show that the two extracted signatures correspond to distinct subnetworks, suggesting some sort of orthogonality.

To investigate the genesis of such envelope correlations, we consider a whole-brain network model assuming two distinct fundamental scenarios: one where each brain area generates oscillations in a single frequency, and a novel one where each brain area can generate oscillations in multiple frequency bands. The models share, as a common generator of damped oscillations, the normal form of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation operating at the critical border between the steady state and the oscillatory regime. The envelopes of the simulated signals are compared with empirical MEG data using new methods to analyse the envelope dynamics in terms of their phase coherence and stability across the spectrum of carrier frequencies. Considering the whole-brain model with a single frequency generator in each brain area, we obtain the best fit with the empirical MEG data when the fundamental frequency is tuned at 12Hz. However, when multiple frequency generators are placed at each local brain area, we obtain an improved fit of the spatio-temporal structure of on-going MEG data across all frequency bands.

Among the many analysis tools available, dynamic models of brain activity have been developed to overcome the limitations of original connectivity measures such as functional connectivity. In particular, much effort has been devoted to the assessment of directional interactions between brain areas from their observed activity. This opinion article summarizes our recent approach to analyze fMRI data based on our whole-brain effective connectivity, which relies on the multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (MOU) and is thus referred to as MOU-EC. Meanwhile, we also discuss the pros and cons of its underlying assumptions with respect to other established approaches. Once tuned, the model provides a connectivity measure that reflects the dynamical state of BOLD activity obtained using fMRI, which can be used to explore the brain cognition. We focus on two important applications. First, as a connectivity measure, MOU-EC can be used to extract biomarkers for task-specific brain coordination, understood as the patterns of areas exchanging information. The multivariate nature of connectivity measures raises several challenges for whole-brain analysis, for which machine-learning tools presents some advantages over statistical testing. Second, we show how to interpret changes in MOU-EC connections in a collective and model-based manner, bridging with network analysis. To illustrate our framework, we use a dataset where subjects were recorded in two conditions, watching a movie and a black screen (referred to as rest). Our framework provides a comprehensive set of tools that open exciting perspectives for the study of distributed cognition, as well as neuropathologies."

Although the storage capacity limit has been thoroughly studied [1], its origin still remains a matter of debate. Several neurophysiological studies suggest that items are maintained in working memory through elevated firing activity in cortical neural assemblies that selectively respond to specific stimuli. Accounting for this experimental observation, Edin et al. [2] proposed a mechanistic explanation of the top-down control of working memory capacity and, based on a mean-field analysis, established an upper boundary to the number of items that can be held in memory. By also making use of a recurrent network model of working memory [3], we have further investigated the mechanisms underlying working memory capacity while also accounting for the two following experimental observations: 1) visual saliency reduces the number of items that can be held in working memory, and 2) visually salient items are commonly kept in memory in delay match-to-sample tasks at the cost of not keeping as many non-salient items.

Moreover, the simulation results suggest a very simple explanation for the aspect of “sub-threshold” learning (Watanabe et al. in Nature 413:844–884, 2001) as well as the relearning of motion discrimination after damage to primary visual cortex as recently reported (Huxlin et al. in J Neurosci 29:3981–3991, 2009) and at least indicate that perceptual learning might only occur when accompanied by conscious percepts."

Small-worldness, path length, efficiency and several other graph theoretical metrics have allowed characterizing anatomical and functional network organization. In a recent study [1], an analysis of resting-state functional networks of healthy volunteers and people with schizophrenia revealed a number of significant topological differences across groups, namely improved global efficiency, reduced small-worldness, lower clustering, increased hierarchy and greater robustness in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy subjects. Moreover, these parameters were found correlate with the verbal fluency score, an indicator of disease severity. These results suggest a subtle functional network randomization in schizophrenia. Actually, schizophrenia, characterized by a dysfunctional integration of cognitive processes, is often classified as a disconnection syndrome. This can be understood in terms of abnormal functional connectivity between cortical areas as observed in EEG and fMRI experiments. A disruption of such interactions may therefore underlie the cognitive and behavioral disturbances described in schizophrenia. In addition, a recent diffusion tensor imaging study [2] reports an overall lower anatomical connectivity in patients than control subjects. This suggests that the functional network alterations underlying schizophrenia could be originated by a widespread deficit in anatomical coupling. In the present work we investigated the effect of decreasing the neurodynamical coupling strength in the topological properties of simulated functional networks. We used a large-scale dynamical model of local neural ensembles coupled through anatomical white matter fibers. Spontaneous neuronal activity was obtained from simulations and transformed into blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal. Functional networks were obtained by computing and thresholding the BOLD signals’ correlation matrix. Graph theoretical measures were then calculated for all the simulated graphs. Results show that the networks’ topological properties vary with coupling strength. In more detail, when the neurodynamical coupling strength is decreased in the model, resulting networks exhibit an increase in global efficiency, hierarchy and robustness and a decrease in small-worldness and clustering, as reported for functional networks of people with schizophrenia. In addition, the shape of the degree distribution also changed accordingly. Moreover, the metrics are in the range of the ones reported experimentally in health and when the coupling strength is decreased by 6%, the measures are closer to the ones reported for schizophrenia (see Table ​Table11).

By using nonspeech stimuli, it is possible to investigate the degree to which audiovisual processing is specific to the speech domain. It has been shown in a match-to-sample design that matching across modalities is more difficult in the nonspeech domain as compared to the speech domain. We constructed a biophysically realistic neural network model simulating this experimental evidence. We propose that a stronger connection between modalities in speech underlies the behavioral difference between the speech and the nonspeech domain. This could be the result of more extensive experience with speech stimuli. Because the match-to-sample paradigm does not allow us to draw conclusions concerning the integration of auditory and visual information, we also simulated two further conditions based on the same paradigm, which tested the integration of auditory and visual information within a single stimulus. New experimental data for these two conditions support the simulation results and suggest that audiovisual integration of discordant stimuli is stronger in speech than in nonspeech stimuli. According to the simulations, the connection strength between auditory and visual information, on the one hand, determines how well auditory information can be assigned to visual information, and on the other hand, it influences the magnitude of multimodal integration."

Single cell recordings show that attention reduces both the neural variability and correlations in the attended condition with respect to the non-attended one. This reduction of variability and redundancy enhances the information associated with the detection and further processing of the attended stimulus. Beyond the attentional paradigm, the local activity in a neural circuit can be modulated in a number of ways, leading to the general question of understanding how the activity of such circuits is sensitive to these relatively small modulations. Here, using an analytically tractable neural network model, we demonstrate how this enhancement of information emerges when excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents are balanced. In particular, we show that the network encoding sensitivity -as measured by the Fisher information- is maximized at the exact balance. Furthermore, we find a similar result for a more realistic spiking neural network model. As the regime of balanced inputs has been experimentally observed, these results suggest that this regime is functionally important from an information encoding standpoint."

Structural connectivity (SC) captures the anatomical pathways across the brain and functional connectivity (FC) measures the correlation between the activity of brain regions. These connectivity measures have been much studied using network theory in order to uncover the distributed organization of brain structures, in particular FC for task-specific brain communication. However, the application of network theory to study FC matrices is often ""static"" despite the dynamic nature of time series obtained from fMRI. The present study aims to overcome this limitation by introducing a network-oriented analysis applied to whole-brain effective connectivity (EC) useful to interpret the brain dynamics. Technically, we tune a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to reproduce the statistics of the whole-brain resting-state fMRI signals, which provides estimates for EC as well as input properties (similar to local excitabilities). The network analysis is then based on the network response (or Green function) that describes the interactions between nodes across time for the estimated dynamics. This model-based approach provides time-dependent graph-like descriptors -communicability and flow- that characterize the roles that either nodes or connections play in the propagation of activity within the network. They can be used at both global and local levels, and also enables the comparison of estimates from real data with surrogates (e.g., random network or ring lattice). In contrast to classical graph approaches to study SC or FC, our framework stresses the importance of taking the temporal aspect of fMRI signals into account. Our results show a merging of functional communities over time (in which input properties play a role), moving from segregated to global integration of the network activity. Our formalism sets a solid ground for the analysis and interpretation of fMRI data, including task-evoked activity."

This question has been mainly addressed by means of statistical models (Green, 1958), or by biologically plausible models (Schnupp et al., 2005). One of the most widely accepted statistical frameworks is the signal detection theory (SDT; Green and Swets, 1966) because it provides a straightforward way to assess whether two sensory stimuli are judged independently of one another, that is when the detectability (d′) of the compound stimulus exceeds the Pythagorean sum of the d′ of the components. Here, we question this logic, and propose a different baseline to evaluate integrative effects in multi-stimuli detection tasks based on the probabilistic summation. To this aim, we show how a simple theoretical hypothesis based on probabilistic summation can explain putative multisensory enhancement in an audio-tactile detection task. In addition, we illustrate how to measure integrative effects from multiple stimuli in two experiments, one using a multisensory audio-tactile detection task (Experiment 1) and another with a unimodal double-stimulus auditory detection task (Experiment 2). Results from Experiment 1 replicate extant multisensory detection data, and also refuse the hypothesis that auditory and tactile stimuli integrated into a single percept, leading to any enhancement. In Experiment 2, we further support the probabilistic summation model using a unimodal integration detection task."

We asked if the scaling properties of these correlations differ between amplitude and phase fluctuations, which may reflect different aspects of cortical functioning. Using source-reconstructed magneto-encephalographic signals, we found power-law scaling for the collective amplitude and for phase synchronization, both capturing whole-brain activity. The temporal changes of the amplitude comprise slow, persistent memory processes, whereas phase synchronization exhibits less temporally structured and more complex correlations, indicating a fast and flexible coding. This distinct temporal scaling supports the idea of different roles of amplitude and phase in cortical functioning."

Although conceptually appealing, the network-theoretical approach to sensor-level EEG and MEG data is challenged by the fact that EEG and MEG time-series are mixtures of source activity. It is therefore of interest to assess the relationship between functional networks of source activity and the ensuing sensor-level networks. Since these topological features are of high interest in experimental studies, we address the question of to what extent the network topology can be reconstructed from sensor-level functional connectivity measures in case of MEG data. Simple simulations that consider only a small number of regions do not allow to assess network properties; therefore, we use a diffusion MRI-constrained whole-brain computational model of resting-state activity. Our motivation lies behind the fact that still many contributions found in the literature perform network analysis at sensor level, and we aim at showing the discrepancies between source- and sensor-level network topologies using realistic simulations of resting-state cortical activity. Our main findings are that the effect of field spread on network topology depends on the type of interaction (instantaneous or lagged) and leads to an underestimation of lagged functional connectivity at sensor level due to instantaneous mixing of cortical signals, instantaneous interaction is more sensitive to field spread than lagged interaction, and discrepancies are reduced when using planar gradiometers rather than axial gradiometers. We therefore recommend to use lagged interaction measures on planar gradiometer data when investigating network properties of resting-state sensor-level MEG data."

Our framework also describes how the properties of external inputs contribute to the network activity, by defining the measure of flow. We illustrate the interplay between network connectivity and input properties with several classical network examples, such as the small-world ring network and the hierarchical network. Our theory defines a comprehensive framework to study and compare directed weighted networks, from pairwise interactions to global properties (e.g., small-worldness) and community detection."

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the reconstruction error is a Lyapunov function of the herein proposed recurrent network. Our model of the primary visual cortex combines a modulatory feedforward strategy and a feedback subtractive correction for obtaining an optimal coding. The fed back error is used in our system for a dynamical improvement of the feedforward Gabor representation of the images, in the sense that the feedforward redundant representation due to the non-orthogonality of the Gabor wavelets is dynamically corrected. The redundancy of the Gabor feature representation is therefore dynamically eliminated by improving the reconstruction capability of the internal representation. The dynamics therefore introduce a nonlinear correction to the standard linear representation of Gabor filters that generates a more efficient predictive coding."

During stimulus presence, feed-forward information (VPL → S1) increased as a function of the stimulus amplitude, while pure feed-back information (S1 → VPL) was unaffected. In parallel, zero-lag interaction emerged with increasing stimulus amplitude, reflecting externally driven thalamocortical synchronization during stimulus processing. Furthermore, VPL → S1 information decreased during error trials. Also, VPL → S1 and zero-lag interaction decreased when monkeys were not required to report the stimulus presence.

Across all patients, we found significant increases in integration and decreases in segregation during cognitive processing, especially in the gamma band (50–90 Hz).

The electrophysiological underpinnings of RSNs remain largely elusive and it has been shown only recently that electrophysiological cortical rhythms are organized into RSNs. Most electrophysiological studies into RSNs use magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography (EEG), which limits the spatial scale on which RSNs can be investigated. Due to their close proximity to the cortical surface, electroencephalographic (ECoG) recordings can potentially provide a more detailed picture of the functional organization of resting-state cortical rhythms. In this study we propose using source-space independent component analysis for identifying generators of resting-state cortical rhythms as recorded with ECoG and reconstructing their network structure. Their network structure is characterized by two kinds of connectivity: instantaneous correlations between band-limited amplitude envelopes and oscillatory phase-locking. Using simulated data, we find that the reconstruction of oscillatory phase-locking is more challenging than that of amplitude correlations, particularly for low signal-to-noise levels. Specifically, phase-lags can both be over- and underestimated as a consequence of first-order and higher-order volume-conduction effects, which troubles the interpretation of interaction measures based on imaginary phase-locking or coherence. The methodology is applied to resting-state beta (15-30 Hz) rhythms within the motor system of a macaque monkey and leads to the identification of a functional network of seven cortical generators that are distributed across the sensorimotor system. The spatial extent of the identified generators, together with consistent phase-lags, suggests that these rhythms can be viewed as being spatially continuous with complex dynamics including traveling waves. Our findings illustrate the level of spatial detail attainable with source-projected ECoG and motivates wider use of the methodology for studying resting-state as well as event-related cortical dynamics in macaque and human."

Using 50 longitudinal resting state sessions of one single subject and single resting state sessions from a group of 50 participants we demonstrated that individual global and local brain dynamics can be estimated consistently with respect to a reference group using only a scanning time of 15 to 20 minutes. We also showed that brain hubs are closer to a transition point between synchronous and asynchronous oscillatory dynamics and that dynamics in frontal areas have larger variations compared to other regions. Finally, we analyzed the variability and error of these dynamics and found high symmetry between hemispheres, which interestingly was reduced by adding more sessions.

Moreover, we show that practically all observed inter-region variability (at the link-level) is not significant and due to the statistical uncertainty of the estimator itself rather than to genuine variability among areas. Finally, we use the proposed statistical framework to demonstrate that, despite the poor consistency of single links, the information carried by the whole-brain spontaneous correlation structure is indeed robust, and can in fact be used as a functional fingerprint."

This dynamical landscape may be defined in terms of spontaneous transitions within a repertoire of discrete metastable states of functional connectivity (FC), which underlie different mental processes. However, it remains unclear how the brain9s dynamical landscape might be changed in altered states of consciousness, such as the psychedelic state. The present study investigated changes in the brain9s dynamical repertoire in an fMRI dataset of healthy participants intravenously injected with the psychedelic compound psilocybin, which is found in ""magic mushrooms"". We employed a data-driven approach to study brain dynamics in the psychedelic state, which focuses on the dominant FC pattern captured by the leading eigenvector of dynamic FC matrices, and enables the identification of recurrent FC patterns (""FC-states""), and their transition profiles over time. We found that a FC state closely corresponding to the fronto-parietal control system was strongly destabilized in the psychedelic state, while transitions toward a globally synchronized FC state were enhanced. These differences between brain state trajectories in normal waking consciousness and the psychedelic state suggest that the latter biases a global mode of functional integration at the expense of locally segregated activity in specific networks. These results provide a mechanistic perspective on subjective quality of the psychedelic experience, and further raise the possibility that mapping the brain9s dynamical landscape may help guide pharmacological interventions in neuropsychiatric disorders."

Some insight has come from modern neuroimaging techniques, which offer an unparalleled opportunity to explore in vivo the structure and function of the brain. In particular, a number of studies have found significant alterations in large-scale resting-state functional connectivity (FC) in the disease. The origin of these FC alterations and its potential link with the underlying structure, remain unclear. The FC between brain areas during rest (measured as the temporal correlations of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal recorded with functional MRI (fMRI)), is known to be strongly shaped by the underlying structural connectivity. However, the relationship between anatomical and functional brain connectivity is not trivial and computational models of large-scale neural dynamics are unique tools to explore this relationship [1-3]. Importantly, models can be used to predict the effects of structural alterations on the large-scale brain dynamics [4,5], which is beyond reach on the experimental side. In this work, the structural connectomes from XX patients with schizophrenia and from XX age- and gender-matched controls were built from DTI data using advanced tractography algorithms to detect the white matter tracts between 90 brain areas. In the model, each brain area was represented by a pool of spiking neurons, and its activity was described by a dynamic mean field model. Each brain area -or node in the global network- receives excitatory input from structurally connected regions in proportion to the number of fibre tracts detected, which may vary from subject to subject. The large-scale spontaneous activity, simulated with the model using the different structural connectomes, was compared between patients and controls. We have found that, in schizophrenia, the coupling weights are weaker, which shifts the bifurcation point (above which the dynamics becomes unstable) to a higher global coupling weight. In addition, the simulated mean field activity was transformed into BOLD signal, and the properties of the simulated FCs were analyzed using measures from graph theory. Our results indicate that the subtle randomization of functional networks occurring in schizophrenia is related to alterations in the underlying structural connectivity, which shift the dynamical regime of the brain at rest further away from the bifurcation point, which may have an impact on the behavioural symptoms of schizophrenia."

It has been argued that this whole-brain orchestration is carried out by a core subset of integrative brain regions, commonly referred to as the ‘global workspace’, although quantifying the constitutive brain regions has proven elusive. We developed a normalised directed transfer entropy (NDTE) framework for determining the pairwise bidirectional causal flow between brain regions and applied it to multimodal whole-brain neuroimaging from over 1000 healthy participants. We established the full brain hierarchy and common regions in a ‘functional rich club’ (FRIC) coordinating the functional hierarchical organisation during rest and task. FRIC contains the core set of regions, which similar to a ‘club’ of functional hubs are characterized by a tendency to be more densely functionally connected among themselves than to the rest of brain regions from where they integrate information. The invariant global workspace is the intersection of FRICs across rest and seven tasks, and was found to consist of the precuneus, posterior and isthmus cingulate cortices, nucleus accumbens, putamen, hippocampus and amygdala that orchestrate the functional hierarchical organisation based on information from perceptual, long-term memory, evaluative and attentional systems. We confirmed the causal significance and robustness of this invariant global workspace by systematically lesioning a generative whole-brain model accurately simulating the functional hierarchy defined by NDTE. Overall, this is a major step forward in understanding the complex choreography of information flow within the functional hierarchical organisation of the human brain."

In particular, its baseline neural activity for idle subjects or animals has a specific structure, also called functional connectivity (FC): cortical areas experience correlated fluctuations at rest as revealed by imaging techniques (e.g., fMRI, EEG and MEG). Moreover, these correlation patterns become more expressed or suppressed depending on the engaged task. The putative function for this stereotypical background activity has been actively questioned by the neuroscience community. A Bayesian hypothesis is that it reflects the variety of possible coactivations of cortical areas for usual tasks, forming a prior representation of the environment and interactions wherewith. The present study relies on our recently developed model [1] in which noise diffusion is constrained by intracortical white-matter projections to reproduce FC observed in experimental data (fMRI BOLD signal). In this model, noise has a functional role and represents the variability of neural activity during tasks. This model allows us to explore the role of various parameters in shaping FC, such as the local nonlinear dynamics of cortical areas. More importantly, we can infer the efficacies of intracortical projections, also called effective connectivity (EC), from experimental data. EC plays a crucial role in shaping FC and differs from the structural connectivity (SC) that is typically obtained using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which estimates the density of white-matter fibers. It is important to notice that the efficacies of these fibers may differ from their density, due to the concentration of synapses formed at their end, the type of neurotransmitters associated and the excitability of target neural populations. In the end, our model combines anatomical SC and activity FC to evaluate what drives the neural dynamics, embodied in EC. Practically, directed EC can be estimated using two matrices of empirical FC, namely FC0 for correlations with zero time shift and FCτ for correlations with a given time shift τ>0. We apply our method to infer the intracortical EC from experimental fMRI data that consists of ~20 minutes of recording for 25 idle subjects. The model reproduces both empirical FC0 and FCτ matrices with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.65. The recovered EC connectivity is significantly asymmetric, with a value of 0.3 for an index that scales from 0 for symmetric matrices to 1 for asymmetric matrices. Moreover, EC exhibits hubs that have either strong incoming or outgoing weights, but not both. This disassortative property is expected to exert a strong influence in shaping the whole network dynamics."

Remarkably, this leads to an expansion of the repertoire of active brain states, suggestive of a general re-organization of brain dynamics given the non-random increase in co-activation across frequencies. Interestingly, the frequency distribution of the active repertoire of brain states under LSD closely follows power-laws indicating a re-organization of the dynamics at the edge of criticality.

We asked what general mechanisms are responsible for the emergence and disappearance of these (de)synchronization patterns. To answer this question we analytically revealed potential effects of physiologically motivated time delays in neural populations. We investigated a network of Neural Mass Models (NMM), here Freeman's seminal model that has successfully been used to model alpha-oscillations [1] and EEG activity in the olfactory system [2] and visual cortex [3]. In contrast to these local applications we were interested in distributed activities over larger networks and hence coupled arbitrarily many NMMs involving the aforementioned time delays. That is, we represented activity in distinct brain areas by means of oscillatory excitatory/inhibitory pairs and consider network behavior as representative for global brain activity. We characterized synchronization as the appearance of clustered stationary phase probability density functions (PDFs). In general, this requires a phase dynamics description of the network, which can be established by applying a slowly varying amplitude approximation (see also [4]), together with a continuity equation covering the PDF's evolution. In fact we succeeded to show the existence of synchronized phase PDFs even for small inter area coupling strengths in the case of both zero and constant finite delays, whereas synchronization disappeared when delays were distributed throughout the network. Homogeneity of the effective coupling matrices (D) appearing in the phase dynamics equation is crucial in this respect as it is required for the existence of clustered phase PDFs. Loss of homogeneity in D can be caused by distributed delays as well as heterogeneity in the structural coupling matrix, leading to the conclusion that the mechanism modulating desynchronization is equal for both cases. The effect of distributed delays is consistent with analytic results in phase oscillator systems [5,6]. This also holds for the drop in oscillation frequency for increased time delay values [5,7] that we observed in simulation results. These two findings validate the description of network behavior in terms of its phase dynamics. In biologically more realistic networks time delays have been shown to determine network synchronization properties in a similar way [8]. Furthermore delays have turned out to be crucial in the behavior of resting state networks [9]. Our results suggest that structural heterogeneity may be compensated for by an appropriate distribution of time delays, thereby explaining the necessity of time delays in RSNs to establish biological plausible synchronization patterns."

We propose that the symptoms of schizophrenia are related to alterations in the depth of the basins of attraction, and the statistical effects of spiking neurons, which together influence the stability of cortical attractor neural networks. The cognitive symptoms such as distractibility, working memory deficits and poor attention could be caused by instability of persistent attractor states in prefrontal cortical networks. The negative symptoms, which include a lack of affect and reduction of emotions, may be related to the concomitant decreased firing rates in cortical areas such as the orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex that occur when the depth of the basins of attraction are reduced. The positive symptoms including delusions, paranoia, and hallucinations could arise because the basins of attraction are shallow in temporal lobe semantic memory networks. This would lead thoughts to move too freely around the attractor energy landscape, loosely from thought to weakly associated thought. These hypotheses were investigated in a model of a cortical attractor network based on integrate-and-fire neurons and synaptic currents activated by AMPA, NMDA and GABA receptors [1]. It was found that a decrease in the NMDA receptor conductance leads to a decrease in the stability of working memory states, an increase in distractibility, and lower firing rates, and can potentially account for both the cognitive and negative symptoms. We observed a flat energy landscape associated with the positive symptoms of schizophrenia when, in addition to a reduction in the NMDA conductance, the GABA conductance was reduced. This caused the dynamical system not only to switch between the high firing rate attractor states, but also sometimes to jump from spontaneous activity into one of the attractor states. The findings are consistent with the neurophysiological effects of dopamine, which can influence NMDA and GABA currents. In this approach we thus start with a statistical dynamical systems framework, and use this to help understand how some of the different symptoms of schizophrenia might arise."

In this study we describe a method for analyzing the latency structure within BOLD-fMRI data and apply it to resting-state data of 94 participants from the Human Connectome Project. The method shows that task-positive and task-negative networks are integrated through traveling BOLD waves within early visual cortex. The waves are initiated at the periphery of the visual field and propagate towards the fovea. This observation suggests a mechanism for the functional integration of task-positive and task-negative networks, argues for an eccentricity-based view on visual information processing, and contributes to the emerging view that resting-state BOLD-fMRI fluctuations are superpositions of inherently spatiotemporal patterns."

These frequency-specific interactions are fundamental for attention, perception, learning, and memory as highlighted by extant literature. Individually, brain areas exhibit oscillatory neuro-electromagnetic signals emerging from a cascade of complex physiological processes. Efficient cognition demands seamless interaction between these different oscillatory modules of the brain. Recent models of large-scale spontaneous brain activity have underscored the importance of brain-wide coherence in bringing about facilitative patterns of activity. Additionally, the allied but independent concept of global metastability casts the understanding of the transient nature of the stability of brain connectivity patterns within a dynamic framework. Since healthy aging is accompanied by changes in large-scale spontaneous electromagnetic oscillations, we asked if the variability and complexity of communication between brain areas with aging could be quantified with global coherence and metastability. Finding such patterns in resting-state MEG would naturally pave the way for tracking task relevant changes in metastability and coherence dynamics that could crucially determine cognitive flexibility and performance in elderly individuals. While previously reported observations of a reduction in peak alpha frequency and increased beta power in older adults are reflective of changes at individual sensors (during rest and task), global coherence and metastability truly pinpoint the underlying coordination dynamic across multiple brain areas across the entire lifespan. This study was not only able to replicate the previous observations in a substantially larger lifespan cohort than what was previously reported, but we also demonstrate, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, age-related changes in coherence and metastability. Furthermore, we observed a marked frequency dependence in changes in global coordination dynamics, which, coupled with the long-held view of specific frequency bands subserving different aspects of cognition, hints at different functional processing roles for slower and faster brain dynamics."

We review an information-theoretic based method that introduces the concept of information flow as such a criterion. The information flow describes the progressive loss of statistical dependence between the entire past and a point ahead in the future, which is indirectly related with the hidden dynamic of the signal. An approximated measure of information flow can be used as the discriminating statistic for selecting the optimal Markov model in terms of the shortest memory required. This technique is applied to investigate the underlying Markovian dynamics of the heart rate variability (HRV) for subjects in different patho-physiological conditions.

Paradoxically, it is not clear how a neuronal dynamical system running in the fixed human anatomical connectome can give rise to the rich changes in the functional repertoire associated with human brain function, which is impossible to explain through long-term plasticity. Neuromodulation evolved to allow for such flexibility by dynamically updating the effectivity of the fixed anatomical connectivity. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework modeling the dynamical mutual coupling between the neuronal and neurotransmitter systems. We demonstrate that this framework is crucial to advance our understanding of whole-brain dynamics by bidirectional coupling of the two systems through combining multimodal neuroimaging data (diffusion magnetic resonance imaging [dMRI], functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI], and positron electron tomography [PET]) to explain the functional effects of specific serotoninergic receptor (5-HT2AR) stimulation with psilocybin in healthy humans. This advance provides an understanding of why psilocybin is showing considerable promise as a therapeutic intervention for neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and addiction. Overall, these insights demonstrate that the whole-brain mutual coupling between the neuronal and the neurotransmission systems is essential for understanding the remarkable flexibility of human brain function despite having to rely on fixed anatomical connectivity."

Recent studies suggest a strong relationship between resting and task FC. Furthermore, the relationship between resting and task FC has been shown to reflect individual differences. Particularly, various studies have demonstrated that the FC has higher reliability and provides enhanced detection of individual differences while viewing natural scenes. Although the large-scale organization of FC during rest and movie-viewing conditions have been well studied in relation to individual variations, the re-organization of FC during viewing natural scenes have not been studied in depth. In this study, we used principal component analysis on FC during rest and movie-viewing condition to characterize the dimensionality of FC patterns across conditions and subjects. We found that the variations in FC patterns related to viewing natural scenes can be explained by a single component, which enables identification of the task over subjects with 100% accuracy. We showed that the FC mode associated to viewing natural scenes better reflects individual variations. Furthermore, we investigated the signatures of movie-viewing-specific functional modes in dynamic FC based on phase-locking values between brain regions. We found that the movie-specific functional mode is persistent across time; suggesting the emergence of a stable processing mode. To explain the reorganization of whole-brain FC through the changes in local dynamics, we appeal to a large-scale computational model. This modelling suggested that the reorganization of whole-brain FC is associated to the interaction between frontal-parietal and frontal-temporal activation patterns."

Interestingly, these temporal oscillations are highly correlated among spatially distributed cortical areas forming structured correlation patterns known as the resting state networks, although the brain is never truly at 9rest9. Here, we introduce the concept of ""harmonic brain modes"" - fundamental building blocks of complex spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity. We define these elementary harmonic brain modes as harmonic modes of structural connectivity; i.e. connectome harmonics, yielding fully synchronous neural activity patterns with different frequency oscillations emerging on and constraint by the particular structure of the brain. Hence, this particular definition implicitly links the hitherto poorly understood dimensions of space and time in brain dynamics and its underlying anatomy. Further we show how harmonic brain modes can explain the relationship between neurophysiological, temporal and network-level changes in the brain across different mental states; (wakefulness, sleep, anaesthesia, psychedelic). Notably, when decoded as activation of connectome harmonics, spatial and temporal characteristics of neural activity naturally emerge from the interplay between excitation and inhibition and this critical relation fits the spatial, temporal and neurophysiological changes associated with different mental states. Thus, the introduced framework of harmonic brain modes not only establishes a relation between the spatial structure of correlation patterns and temporal oscillations (linking space and time in brain dynamics), but also enables a new dimension of tools for understanding fundamental principles underlying brain dynamics in different states of consciousness."

Here, we provide cross-validated evidence that such changes are initiated by an alteration of physiological network state dynamics. Specifically, our analysis of long intracranial EEG recordings from a group of 10 patients identifies a critical phase of a few hours in which time-dependent network states become less variable (""degenerate"") and is followed by a global functional connectivity reduction before seizure onset. This critical phase is characterized by an abnormal occurrence of highly correlated network instances and is shown to particularly affect the activity of resection regions in patients with validated post-surgical outcome. Our approach characterizes pre-seizure networks dynamics as a cascade of two sequential events providing new insights into seizure prediction and control."

The reasoning behind this is that extra-cellular potentials caused by spikes travelling along axons are too small to have an effect on other axons. Here we devise a computational framework that allows us to study the effect of extracellular potentials generated by spike volleys in axonal fibre bundles on axonal transmission delays. We demonstrate that, although the extracellular potentials generated by single spikes are of the order of microvolts, the collective extracellular potential generated by spike volleys can reach several millivolts. As a consequence, the resulting depolarisation of the axonal membranes increases the velocity of spikes, and therefore reduces axonal delays between brain areas. Driving a neural mass model with such spike volleys, we further demonstrate that only ephaptic coupling can explain the reduction of stimulus latencies with increased stimulus intensities, as observed in many psychological experiments."

In this paper, we used dynamic functional connectivity to calculate the probability of anti-correlations between brain regions. The brain regions forming task-positive and task-negative networks showed high anti-correlation probabilities. The fluctuations in anti-correlation probabilities were significantly correlated with those in global average signal and functional connectivity. We investigated the mechanisms behind these fluctuations using whole-brain computational modeling approach. We found that the underlying effective connectivity and intrinsic noise reflect the static spatiotemporal patterns, whereas the hemodynamic response function is the key factor defining the fluctuations in functional connectivity and anti-correlations. Furthermore, we illustrated the clinical implications of these findings on a group of bipolar disorder patients suffering a depressive relapse (BPD)."

For the significantly different effective connectivities in schizophrenia, on average the forward (stronger) effective connectivities were smaller, whereas the backward connectivities tended to be larger. Further, higher EC in schizophrenia was found from the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) to areas such as the parahippocampal, hippocampal, temporal, fusiform, and occipital cortices.

Lower effective connectivities were found from temporal and other regions and were negatively correlated with the symptoms, especially the negative and general symptoms.

In particular, condition-specific signature should not be contaminated by subject-related information. Practically, signatures correspond to subnetworks of directed interactions between brain regions (typically 100 covering the whole brain) supporting the subject and condition identification for single fMRI sessions. The key for robust prediction is using effective connectivity instead of functional connectivity. Our method demonstrates excellent generalization capabilities for subject identification in two datasets, using only a few sessions per subject as reference. Using another dataset with resting state and movie viewing, we show that the two signatures related to subjects and tasks correspond to distinct subnetworks, which are thus topologically orthogonal.

In the present paper, we use a whole-cortex model to estimate directed interactions between 68 cortical regions from fMRI activity for four different tasks (reflecting different cognitive domains) and resting state. We analyze the state-dependent input and output effective connectivity of the rich club and relate these to whole-cortex dynamics and network reconfigurations. We find that the cortical rich club exhibits an increase in outgoing effective connectivity during task performance as compared to rest while incoming connectivity remains constant. Increased outgoing connectivity targets a sparse set of peripheral regions with specific regions strongly overlapping between tasks. At the same time, community detection analyses reveal massive reorganizations of interactions among peripheral regions, including those serving as target of increased rich cub output. This suggests that while peripheral regions can play a role in several tasks, their interplay might nonetheless be task-specific. Furthermore, we observe that whole-cortex dynamics are faster during task as compared to rest. The decoupling effects usually accompanying faster dynamics appear to be counteracted by the increased rich club outgoing effective connectivity. Together our findings speak to a gating mechanism of the rich club that supports fast-paced information exchange among relevant peripheral regions in a task-specific and goal-directed fashion, while constantly listening to the whole network."

Not all components of such patterns are equally characteristic for each brain state, but machine learning provides a possibility for extracting and comparing the structure of brain states from functional data. However, their characterization in terms of functional connectivity measures varies widely, from cross-correlation to phase coherence, and the idea that different measures provide similar or coherent information is a common assumption made in neuroimaging. Here, we compare the brain state signatures extracted from of phase coherence, pairwise covariance, correlation, regularized covariance and regularized precision for a dataset of subjects performing five different cognitive tasks. In addition, we compare the classification performance in identifying the tasks for each connectivity measure. The measures are evaluated in their ability to discriminate the five tasks with two types of crossvalidation: within-subject cross-validation, which reflects the stability of the signature over time; and between-subject cross-validation, which aims at extracting signatures that generalize across subjects. Secondly, we compare the informative features (connections or links between brain regions/areas) across measures to test the assumption that similar information is obtained about brain state signatures from different connectivity measures. In our results, the different types of cross-validation give different classification performance and emphasize that functional connectivity measures on fMRI require observation windows of sufficient duration. Furthermore, we find that informative links for the classification, meaning changes between tasks that are consistent across subjects, are entirely uncorrelated between BOLD correlations and covariances. These results indicate that the corresponding FC signature can strongly differ across FC methods used and that interpretation is subject to caution in terms of subnetworks related to a task."

An alternative is their multidimensional and mechanistic characterization in terms of different cognitive capacities, using computational models to reproduce the underlying neural dynamics. We explore this alternative by introducing a semi-empirical model linking regional activation and long-range functional connectivity in the different brain states visited during the natural wake-sleep cycle. Our model combines functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, in vivo estimates of structural connectivity, and anatomically-informed priors to constrain the independent variation of regional activation. The best fit to empirical data was achieved using priors based on functionally coherent networks, with the resulting model parameters dividing the cortex into regions presenting opposite dynamical behavior. Frontoparietal regions approached a bifurcation from dynamics at a fixed point governed by noise, while sensorimotor regions approached a bifurcation from oscillatory dynamics. In agreement with human electrophysiological experiments, sleep onset induced subcortical deactivation with low correlation, which was subsequently reversed for deeper stages. Finally, we introduced periodic forcing of variable intensity to simulate external perturbations, and identified the key regions relevant for the recovery of wakefulness from deep sleep. Our model represents sleep as a state with diminished perceptual gating and the latent capacity for global accessibility that is required for rapid arousals. To the extent that the qualitative characterization of local dynamics is exhausted by the dichotomy between unstable and stable behavior, our work highlights how expanding the model parameter space can describe states of consciousness in terms of multiple dimensions with interpretations given by the choice of anatomically-informed priors."

A prominent feature of alpha oscillations recorded in the absence of stimuli or explicit tasks is their dominance over parietal-occipital midline regions [2]. In this study we combine MEG and diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) to investigate the extent to which the topology of anatomical pathways can explain this dominance. We found that source-projected MEG alpha power correlates with eigenvalue centrality of the DSI-derived structural matrix [3]. In particular, the occipital-parietal dominance could largely be explained by the high density of structural connections within the posterior-medial parts of the structural core [4]. Moreover, more local network characterizations such as clustering coefficient, degree, and node centrality, were unable to explain the posterior dominance, suggesting that alpha power is shaped by global rather than local structural features. To assess the possibility of a causal link between the DSI-derived structural network and the power topography of resting-state alpha oscillations, we constructed a computational model of large-scale brain dynamics. Within the model, alpha oscillations are generated within local circuits [5] and interact through long-range excitatory projections according to the DSI-derived structural topology. We found that, when structurally connected, alpha oscillations indeed dominate over parietal-occipital midline regions. Furthermore, they only did so when the dynamics was in the vicinity of an instability, which is in line with previous modeling work on resting-state BOLD correlations [5]. These findings suggest that the posterior dominance of alpha oscillations could indeed be shaped by the topology of anatomical pathways and that critical dynamics are required. We subsequently investigated which features of the experimentally identified network were crucial in shaping the observed dominance and assessed the role of coherent oscillations. In sum, this study provides experimental and theoretical evidence that alpha oscillations in the human resting brain are structured by the topology of underlying anatomical pathways."

These patterns are not static, but exhibit complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Over the last years, a multitude of methods have been proposed to reveal these dynamics on the level of the whole brain. One finding is that the brain transitions through different FC configurations over time, and substantial effort has been put into characterizing these configurations. However, the dynamics governing these transitions are more elusive, specifically, the contribution of stationary vs. non-stationary dynamics is an active field of inquiry. In this study, we use a whole-brain approach, considering FC dynamics between 66 ROIs covering the entire cortex. We combine an innovative dimensionality reduction technique, tensor decomposition, with a mean field model which possesses stationary dynamics. It has been shown to explain resting state FC averaged over time and multiple subjects, however, this average FC summarizes the spatial distribution of correlations while hiding their temporal dynamics. First, we apply tensor decomposition to resting state scans from 24 healthy controls in order to characterize spatio-temporal dynamics present in the data. We simultaneously utilize temporal and spatial information by creating tensors that are subsequently decomposed into sets of brain regions (""communities"") that share similar temporal dynamics, and their associated time courses. The tensors contain pairwise FC computed inside of overlapping sliding windows. Communities are discovered by clustering features pooled from all subjects, thereby ensuring that they generalize. We find that, on the group level, the data give rise to four distinct communities that resemble known resting state networks (RSNs): default mode network, visual network, control networks, and somatomotor network. Second, we simulate data with our stationary mean field model whose nodes are connected according to results from DTI and fiber tracking. In this model, all spatio-temporal structure is due to noisy fluctuations around the average FC. We analyze the simulated data in the same way as the empirical data in order to determine whether stationary dynamics can explain the emergence of distinct FC patterns (RSNs) which have their own time courses. We find that this is the case for all four networks using the spatio-temporal information revealed by tensor decomposition if nodes in the simulation are connected according to model-based effective connectivity. Furthermore, we find that these results require only a small part of the FC values, namely the highest values that occur across time and ROI pair. Our findings show that stationary dynamics can account for the emergence of RSNs. We provide an innovative method that does not make strong assumptions about the underlying data and is generally applicable to resting state or task data from different subject populations."

In particular, by using a whole-brain dynamical ansatz integrating the underlying anatomical structure with the local node dynamics based on a Lotka-Volterra description, we compute analytically the global attractors of this cooperative system and their associated directed graphs, here called the informational structures.

Here, we used optical imaging of voltage-sensitive dyes to explore, in V4 of an awake macaque, the spatiotemporal characteristics of both visually evoked and spontaneously ongoing neuronal activity and their difference. With respect to the spontaneous case, we detected a reduction in large-scale activity (cortical extent>1  mm) in the alpha range (5 to 12.5 Hz) during sensory inflow accompanied by a decrease in pairwise correlations. Moreover, the spatial patterns of correlation obtained during the different visual stimuli were on the average more similar one to another than they were to that obtained in the absence of stimulation.

While these fluctuations, most prominently those of the default mode network, have been linked to cognitive function, it remains unclear whether they result from random noise or whether they index a non-stationary process which could be described as state switching. In this study, we use a sliding windows approach to relate temporal dynamics of RSNs to global modulations in correlation and BOLD variance. We compare empirical data, phase-randomized surrogate data, and data simulated with a stationary model. We find that RSN time courses exhibit a large amount of coactivation in all three cases, and that the modulations in their activity are closely linked to global dynamics of the underlying BOLD signal. We find that many properties of the observed fluctuations in FC and BOLD, including their ranges and their correlations amongst each other, are explained by fluctuations around the average FC structure.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was analyzed from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) data set in 394 people with autism spectrum disorder and 473 controls, and effective connectivity (EC) was measured between 94 brain areas. First, in autism, the middle temporal gyrus and other temporal areas had lower effective connectivities to the precuneus and cuneus, and these were correlated with the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule total, communication, and social scores. This lower EC from areas implicated in face expression analysis and theory of mind to the precuneus and cuneus implicated in the sense of self may relate to the poor understanding of the implications of face expression inputs for oneself in autism, and to the reduced theory of mind. Second, the hippocampus and amygdala had higher EC to the middle temporal gyrus in autism, and these are thought to be back projections based on anatomical evidence and are weaker than in the other direction. This may be related to increased retrieval of recent and emotional memories in autism. Third, some prefrontal cortex areas had higher EC with each other and with the precuneus and cuneus. Fourth, there was decreased EC from the temporal pole to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and there was evidence for lower activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a brain area implicated in emotion-related decision-making.

LAY SUMMARY: To understand autism spectrum disorders better, it may be helpful to understand whether brain systems cause effects on each other differently in people with autism. In this first large-scale neuroimaging investigation of effective connectivity in people with autism, it is shown that parts of the temporal lobe involved in facial expression identification and theory of mind have weaker effects on the precuneus and cuneus implicated in the sense of self. This may relate to the poor understanding of the implications of face expression inputs for oneself in autism, and to the reduced theory of mind.

Nevertheless, resting activity is not only spatially structured but also shows a very stereotypical temporal structure which is characterized by rapid transitions switching between a few discrete FC states across time. In this talk, we introduce a powerful theoretical framework, which allows us to demonstrate that resting functional connectivity FC dynamics (FCD) constrains more strongly the dynamical working point of whole-brain models. Furthermore, using a very general neural mass model based on the normal form of a Hopf bifurcation we are able to demonstrate that the temporal dynamics of resting state fluctuations emerges at the edge of the transition between asynchronous to oscillatory behavior. Even more importantly, at that particular working point the global metastability of the whole brain is maximized. By optimizing the spectral characteristics of each local brain node, we discover the dynamical core of the brain, i.e., the set of nodes, which drives the rest of the whole brain by oscillations."

The broadness of communication is characterized by functional measures of integration and segregation. Across all patients, we found significant increases in integration and decreases in segregation during cognitive processing, especially in the gamma band (50-90 Hz). Accordingly, we also found significantly higher level of global synchronization and functional connectivity during the execution of the cognitive task, again particularly in the gamma band.

In many experiments, the different alternatives are encoded by quite distinct neuronal groups. In this case, proposed neural models consider that the decision results from the competition between decision-specific neuronal groups, each of these integrating distinct sensory evidence [1]. Alternatively, evidence may be presented in a sequential manner, and the different stimuli may be encoded by the same neuronal group, as exemplified by experiments where monkeys are engaged in a vibrotactile discrimination task [2]. To achieve discrimination in this case, the nervous system needs to keep a trace of the previously presented stimuli. How the correct discrimination can be learned and implemented is poorly understood. To address these questions, we use a modeling approach. We concentrate on the particular case of the vibrotactile discrimination task on which experimental insight has been accumulated over the last years [2]. The partial differential (PD) neurons in monkey area VPC, encoding both sequentially presented vibrotactile stimuli (with frequencies f1 and f2) by keeping the memory of the first one during a delay period, have been reproduced in a spiking neuron network model with short-term facilitating synapses [3]. We want to explore how these PD neurons may be used to discriminate between both stimuli configurations: f1 > f2 or f1 < f2. Based on the experimental evidence, we model a heterogeneous PD neuronal population, encoding both frequencies in multiple ways. Downstream to the first network, we add a competition-based decision making spiking neuron network [1]. To obtain the desired neural dynamics of the coupled two-networks model, we choose the model parameters using a simplified mean-field description of the model. To make the best possible decisions, the strengths of the synapses projecting from the PD neurons to the decision neurons must be learned. Based on reinforcement learning theory, we use a learning rule which maximizes reward. It depends on a reward prediction error, evaluated using the reward history. We instantiate this rule using a reward based spike-timing-dependent plasticity [4]. Learning takes place after the second stimulus presentation. We find that the task can be efficiently learned for any number of PD neuron types, even when their stimulus encoding function is nonlinear and noisy. In conclusion, the present biologically plausible two-networks model is able to solve a perceptual discrimination task under sequential sensory evidence."

Depending on environmental demands, the response is given immediately or is delayed. A well-known paradigm for research in decision making is the comparison of two vibrotactile stimuli (f1, f2) applied to the fingertips with a fixed delay period between them. To complete this cognitive task the subject needs to store the information about the first stimulus, f1, in working memory and to compare it with the second one, f2, to make a decision of whether f1 f2. Further he needs to store in working memory its appropriate response. Along those lines, Lemus et al. (2) introduced an additional delay between the second stimulus and the subject's response. This new operation requires that the subject stores the somatosensory information, the decision and/or the response in working memory during this second delay period. We analysed neurons recorded from the Medial Premotor Cortex in monkeys during the above task. We found some neurons encoded the response just in two periods: after the second stimulus (f2) and when the answer is required, 3 s later. Moreover, those neurons only show relevant activity in these periods. In the present work we investigated the mechanisms that allow the neurons to encode the response information. For this purpose we use Mutual Information (MI) analysis in order to decode the information carried by the firing rates. We measured the MI between the following two variables: the firing rates and the behavioral response (f1 f2) made at the end of the trial. We found that for 157 neurons (18.1% of 867), the MI becomes significant during the second stimulus (f2), it disappears during the post-f2 period, and becomes significant again at the time of the response. Our hypothesis is that this particular pattern is due to a combination of signal-to-noise ratio in the rates, which makes it impossible to decode the information contained in the rates in the postponed response delay period after f2. We hypothesize that the neurons can use synaptic facilitation to allows them to hold the information during the delayed response memory period. Here, we present a biophysically realistic model for decision making with synaptic facilitation (3) extended to account for the activity in the delayed response period. We use integrate-and-fire neurons with three types of receptors mediating the synaptic currents: the excitatory recurrent postsynaptic currents are mediated by AMPA (fast) and NMDA (slow) receptors and the inhibitory recurrent postsynaptic currents to both excitatory and inhibitory neurons are mediated by GABA receptors. The external excitatory recurrent postsynaptic currents injected onto the network are driven only by AMPA receptors. The results show that the network is able to model this neuronal activity using a synaptic facilitation mechanism. After a decision making period the network is able to remember the response despite a low firing level in the delayed response period and to retrieve the memory evident in a high firing rate when a non-specific stimulus is provided just before the response is required. Thus a synaptic facilitation mechanism can implement a mechanism for postponed decisions which can be correct even when there is little neuronal firing during the delay period before the postponed decision."

We estimated the effective connectivity (EC) between brain regions in the model to reproduce observed FC of each subject. First, we compared ECs between groups to identify the changes in underlying connectivity structure. We found that the significant EC changes were restricted to temporal lobe. Then, based on healthy control subjects we systematically manipulated the dynamics in the model to investigate its effect on FC.

Novel techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allow the simultaneous recording of the macroscopic activity from all brain regions while subjects perform various tasks, such as passive hearing and active visual recognition. How neural activity is related to cognitive tasks is a long-standing question for the neuroscience community. This study examines an interesting aspect of this broad question, namely the comparison between the resting state (when the subjects is idle) and evoked activity during a task. Neural activity patterns consist of the correlations of firing activity between cortical regions - or functional connectivity - at a slow time scale (hundreds of ms), which can be related to data obtained from fMRI. The cortex has an intricate architecture of connections, both local and long-range. The latter have been mapped for the whole human cortex using diffusion techniques [1]. A recent model has demonstrated that this broad-scale structural connectivity is crucial to reproduce resting-state patterns of cortical activity [2]. Here we consider the same model and simulate tasks by exciting specific brain regions. We rely on mathematical and numerical analysis in order to uncover the respective roles of the long-range projections and external inputs in shaping the evoked activity. Our primary aim is to understand how the stimulation of specific brain regions can dramatically modify the functional connectivity, as compared to the resting state. We also examine the influence of long-range excitatory projections onto inhibitory populations, a novel dynamical ingredient compared to the previous model, in decorrelating brain regions."

Here, we asked how the learning of a new rule influences neuronal activity in the visual (area V1) and frontal cortex (area FEF) of monkeys. We devised a new icon-selection task. On each day, the monkeys saw 2 new icons (small pictures) and learned which one was relevant. We rewarded eye movements to a saccade target connected to the relevant icon with a curve. Neurons in visual and frontal cortex coded the monkey's choice, because the representation of the selected curve was enhanced. Learning delayed the neuronal selection signals and we uncovered the cause of this delay in V1, where learning to select the relevant icon caused an early suppression of surrounding image elements. These results demonstrate that the learning of a new rule causes a transition from fast and random decisions to a more considerate strategy that takes additional time and they reveal the contribution of visual and frontal cortex to the learning process."

Not much is know yet about the time course of this integration between touch and body posture (e.g., proprioception), called tactile remapping. A tactile localization task in which there is a spatial conflict between the somatotopic and the external spatial representations can provide some constraints on the timing of the proprioceptive signal (necessary for the remapping) relative to the tactile input. Here, we construe this localization task as a perceptual discrimination problem. By making use of established models of decision-making, we aim to shed light on the internal processes during tactile remapping. In the experiment, participants had to make a speeded saccade towards a brief somatosensory stimulus applied to the finger of one hand, while their arms were either crossed or uncrossed about the body midline. The eye movement trajectories were recorded and revealed that especially in the crossed condition fast saccades occasionally started toward the incorrect (anatomically congruent) side and were corrected in-flight, resulting in a turn-around saccade (about 250 ms after tactile onset, which might reflect the completion of tactile remapping). Similar curved traces have been observed recently in a random-dot motion (RDM) discrimination task were subjects had to report their decision by moving a handle to a left or right target [1]. While in the RDM task the curved traces were interpreted as a change of mind, direction-reversal here is thought to be induced by the (delayed) proprioceptive signal. With crossed hands, the current body posture needs to be taken into account and the representation of touch changes through time due to the remapping [2]. In the uncrossed posture remapping is trivial as the anatomical and external reference frames are aligned. In the framework of decision-making and in line with [1], we treat the initial direction of a saccade as a first choice, caused by crossing a decision-threshold. Accordingly, we apply two computational models able to account for changes of mind, a simple drift-diffusion model [1] and a biophysically-realistic nonlinear attractor model [3], to fit experimental reaction-time distributions and performance. In the models, turn-around saccades originate from a second threshold crossing if the accumulated evidence of the initially losing alternative overtakes the first choice. Remapping only the outcome of the decision to a different motor response in the crossed-hand condition proved insufficient to explain the differences in reaction times and performance to the uncrossed case. This suggests that internal differences between the two conditions are already present prior to the decision-making stage. From the modeling perspective the proprioceptive signal thus changes the input (evidence) for deciding on a saccade to the left or right. Allowing only the model inputs to vary between crossed and uncrossed conditions, we gain predictions on the relative size and timing of the internal proprioceptive signal for tactile remapping."

We compare simulated activity based on individual structural connectomes (SC) inferred from diffusion weighted imaging with fMRI and EEG in the resting state. We systematically explore the role of the following model parameters: conduction velocity, global coupling and graph theoretical features of individual SC. First, a subspace of the parameter space is identified for each subject that results in realistic brain activity, i.e. reproducing the following prominent features of empirical EEG-fMRI activity: topology of resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (FC), functional connectivity dynamics (FCD), electrophysiological oscillations in the delta (3-4 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency range and their bimodality, i.e. low and high energy modes. Interestingly, FCD fit, bimodality and static FC fit are highly correlated. They all show their optimum in the same range of global coupling. In other words, only when our local model is in a bistable regime we are able to generate switching of modes in our global network. Second, our simulations reveal the explicit network mechanisms that lead to electrophysiological oscillations, their bimodal behaviour and inter-regional differences. Third, we discuss biological interpretability of the Stefanescu-Jirsa-Hindmarsh-Rose-3D model when embedded inside the large-scale brain network and mechanisms underlying the emergence of bimodality of the neural signal.

In this project we are interested in the specific case of auditory-tactile interactions in the perception of vibrotactile events, an aspect that has not received as much attention as audio-visual or visuo-tactile interactions. The case of audio-tactile interactions deserves special attention. As both modalities respond to the same physical property (mechanical pressure), it’s tempting to predict that such coincidence would allow integrative interactions at a variety of levels of processing, including the earliest ones. In fact, there is ample evidence that tactile events can influence activity in the earliest stages of auditory processing and there are several behavioral demonstrations of auditory influences on tactile perception. Particularly, vibrations in the flutter range (~10-50 Hz) constitute an interesting case for study given that vibratory patterns within this range are represented in the firing rates of the neurons in the sensory cortices for both somatosensory and auditory stimuli. Moreover in this range we have well detailed information given by the neurophysiological experiments. In particular studies describing the neural correlates of perceptual detection of vibrotactile events on the flutter range (e.g. see [2]) show that neurons in S1 respond with a very high degree of fidelity to the temporal profile of the stimulus. Similar results have been achieved with audio stimuli (e.g. see [3]) always on the flutter range. Our intention is to compare human behavioral data with an appropriate computational model in order to offer an appropriate hypothesis on the processing stage or stages where this audio-tactile interactions take place. Thus, we want to test if integration between somatosensory and auditory information does indeed take place on the flutter range as it does for high frequencies [4]. To this aim, we implement the same experiment of [4] for the flutter range; the experiment consists on comparing the detection threshold for audio, tactile and the two senses at the same time. As we want to ascertain whether stimuli integration takes place before or after perceptual detection, we back the behavioral data with a computational analysis of the processes involved by means of a network model composed of integrate-and-fire neurons. The neural network consists of multiple interacting layers, with the hypothesis that the integration happens at a high level processing areas in accordance with recent neurophysiological results [5]. The model can be applied both to flutter and no-flutter ranges. Our preliminary results (see figure ​figure1)1) are in accordance with the behavioral results of [4] (our experimental results are not conclusive).

However, both computational [3] and experimental [4] papers afford a significant role to thalamocortical (ThC) synaptic depression in shaping the temporal response properties of A1. Also, the duration of inhibitory currents in A1 has been an issue of contention [6,7]. Another study of forward masking [5] used noise click stimuli to show that while responses to the probe were not fully recovered even 512 ms after presentation of the masker, inhibitory currents evoked by the masker lasted at most 100 ms, coinciding in duration with the complete suppression of probe responses. The authors proposed that a longer-lasting mechanism such as ThC or intracortical (IC) synaptic depression could complement inhibition by accounting for the lingering effect seen. They also demonstrated that pentobarbital anesthesia significantly prolongs inhibition, thus calling into question results such as [1,2]. Here we present a biophysically detailed, tonotopically organized network model of A1, which employs Hodgkin and Huxley neurons with stochastic synaptic depression in ThC synapses. Our model accounts for forward masking seen with both single tones [1,2] and noise stimuli [5], while showing approximately balanced excitation and inhibition [7-9]. Inspired by [10], we propose a plausible IC connectivity for the layers III and IV of A1, which selectively amplifies the broad input from the thalamus to yield the sharp frequency tuning seen in many studies of A1. We conclude that a combination of IC currents and ThC synaptic depression is imperative for accounting for the wealth of data seen in the neurophysiological literature, such as the phenomena we study here."

On one hand it is a fundamental component of our subjective conscious experience. On the other hand it is crucial to many cognitive functions like action planning and learning. In the past the speed accuracy trade-off in decision-making has received much attention by the scientific community since it is a key aspect of simple decisions, used in experimental conditions. In the context of complex more “real” environments, where different strategies can be applied, besides speed and accuracy, flexibility also become very important. Flexibility is the ability of an agent to explore and use alternative strategies in order to reach the goals. In a more simple view flexibility is the ability of taking into account more options in a decision process. The selection between alternative strategies can be regulated by evaluating the confidence in a choice. If the confidence is too low and other strategies are available, then the subject will try an alternative. Therefore evaluating the confidence in a choice can be particularly helpful for agents in complex dynamic environments. There is only few evidence about neural mechanisms underlying decision confidence [1][2]. New neurophysiological evidence about decision confidence comes from a recent study [3], that tested the ability of monkeys to choose, in a two choice random dot motion (RDM) task, between standard targets and a “sure” target appearing later. This target represents a small but certain reward. Recordings from LIP neurons during the behavioral task show a dependence of firing rate upon certainty in the decision. We propose a theory about neuronal mechanisms of flexibility that can account for LIP data. The theory is implemented in a network model composed of integrate-and-fire neurons with biologically detailed synapses, including AMPA, NDMA and GABA receptors [4]. Our proposal is that, as reported by [2], the confidence is implicitly encoded in the firing-rate of the decision neurons, but there is no need for a reading out of this information. In our model the RDM stimulus generates a competition between two pools of decision neurons, a third pool remains silent until it is turned on by the third target presentation. When all three pools receive task salient stimulus they compete until a decision is reached. In this way the information about confidence in the first decision, stored in the firing-rate, is directly used into the network without the need of an other reading network [2]. We analyze the property of the network in a reduced mean-field model. The first bifurcation in the space of input is connected with speed accuracy trade-off [5]. Our finding is that the proximity with a second bifurcation enhances flexibility, raising the probability of alternative strategies."

The ventral 'what' path is implemented in a physiologically plausible four-layer network, corresponding to brain areas V1, V2, V4 and IT, with convergence to each part of a layer from a small region of the preceding layer, with feature-based attentional feedback connections, and with local competition between the neurons within a layer implemented by local lateral inhibition. In particular, the model explains the gradually increasing magnitude of the attentional modulation that is found in fMRI experiments from earlier visual areas (V1, V2) to higher ventral visual areas (V4, IT). The model also shows how the effective size of the receptive fields of IT neurons becomes smaller in natural cluttered scenes."

This perspective allows to analyze the quality of retrieved connectivity profiles in terms of modeling error and estimation error. In the first part of the chapter, we present undirected functional connectivity (Pearson’s correlation and MI) and effective connectivity (partial correlation), as well as directed effective connectivity (VAR, MOU, Granger causality, DCM). In addition, some of these measures correspond to fully connected graphs (Pearson’s correlation) while others to sparse ones (MOU, DCM), where the sparsity can come from the integration of functional and structural data.

Through the variation of multiple network parameters, our numerical results indicate that directed connections - in the time domain - are more accurately estimated based on the coefficients obtained from multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) than Granger causality analysis, which is based on the error residuals of the same MVAR linear regression. Based on these findings, we propose a non-parametric significance test for connectivity detection, which achieves a good control of false positives (type 1 error) and is robust to various network topologies. When generating surrogate distributions, we compare the effects of circular shifts, random permutations and phase randomization of the observed time series, each breaking down covariances in a specific manner: the MVAR estimates from those shuffled covariances build a null-hypothesis distribution for each connection, from which the original connectivity estimate can be compared.

This is for example interesting in multisensory integration, in which both auditory and visual precepts have to be integrated into one common percept. We used a biophysically realistic neural model consisting of integrate-and-fire neurons with detailed synaptic channels. We studied the influence of the strength of the cross-connection between the two decision-making modules on the performance of the model. The performance was assessed by how often the system can correctly extract the stimulus even though just weak input was applied. We found that the optimal performance of the coupled modules is achieved by a certain cross-connection strength, which is independent of the amplitude of the stimulus input. This means that once an optimal cross-connection has been learned it can be used for all types of stimulus inputs to achieve an optimal performance. We also present the mechanism, which is responsible for this improvement: Inconsistent constellations in the two modules converge to the correct response. We could also simulate the law of inverse effectiveness in our model. We related the strength of the input bias to the multisensory integration index and found an inversely correlated relationship such as observed in experimental data [1]. We also investigated a three-module architecture, in which two primary sensory areas like the auditory and the visual one are connected by a third, integrating module. The 3rd module could correspond to higher processing areas such as the STS, which mediates between the two primary sensory areas. We show that there are similar dynamics as in the two-module case, although the necessary coupling strength between the modules is increased. The coupling is more indirect than in the two-module case. We conclude that decision-making modules can be coupled to increase performance compared to single decision-making module."

In this modelling work, we study how selective attention modulates neuronal activity in different layers of the visual system. We use a two-layer model of integrate-and-fire neurons, modelling attention as an external input biasing the competition. We study the influence of the attentional bias on both the modulation of the firing rates and the gamma frequency synchronisation in both layers. We show that the gamma frequency synchronisation is much higher in the upper layer (V4) than in the lower layer (V1). In addition, the modulation of the synchronisation is generally stronger in the higher layer. Our findings are thus consistent with an increase of the gamma frequency modulation along the visual pathway. This might explain the different findings in [1] and [2], as they measured from different layers in the visual system. We also analyse attentional modulations as a function of the connection strength between the two layers. Our results show that depending on the connection strength, either the rate modulation or the gamma frequency modulation is stronger, suggesting that both play an active role in the encoding of attention."

We showed that cortical state transitions were determined by changes in stiff parameters associated with the activity of a core of neurons with low responses to stimuli and high centrality within the observed network. In contrast, stimulus-evoked responses evolved along sloppy dimensions associated with the activity of neurons with low centrality and displaying large ongoing and stimulus-evoked fluctuations without affecting the integrity of the network.

We introduce a multiscale dynamic mean field (MDMF) model, that captures the synaptic gating dynamics as a function of neurotransmitter kinetics, we demonstrate how local homeostasis of excitatory-inhibitory neurotransmitter concentrations (GABA/glutamate) could modulate the large-scale resting state network dynamics of brain. Simulations were carried out across glutamate (0.1 to 15 mmol) and GABA (0.1 to 15 mmol) concentration regimes that span the parameter space reported from healthy and diseased brains. We have found for optimal configurations of glutamate concentration ranging from 5.6 to 15 mmol and GABA concentration from 0.9 to 15 mmol model predicted functional connectivity matrix show closest match with empirical functional connectivity matrix of normal resting brain. Graph theoretical measures of segregation (modularity, clustering coefficient and local efficiency) and integration (global efficiency and characteristic path length) in network information processing reported earlier in healthy and diseased brains were related to optimal GABA and glutamate concentrations and pathological values reported in epilepsy and schizophrenia respectively. In conclusion, the MDMF model could relate the various scales of observations from neurotransmitter concentrations to dynamics of synaptic gating to large-scale resting state network topology in healthy and in disordered states of the brain. Key words: GABA, glutamate, resting-state functional connectivity, structural connectivity, network measures, epilepsy and schizophrenia."

These resting state patterns are not static, but exhibit complex spatio-temporal dynamics. In the recent years substantial effort has been put to characterize different FC configurations while brain states makes transitions over time. The dynamics governing this transitions and their relationship with stationary functional connectivity remains elusive. Over the last years a multitude of methods has been proposed to discover and characterize FC dynamics and one of the most accepted method is sliding window approach. Moreover, as these FC configurations are observed to be cyclically repeating in time there was further motivation to use of a generic clustering scheme to identify latent states of dynamics. We discover the underlying lower-dimensional manifold of the temporal structure which is further parameterized as a set of local density distributions, or latent transient states. We propose an innovative method that learns parameters specific to these latent states using a graph-theoretic model (temporal Multiple Kernel Learning, tMKL) and finally predicts the grand average functional connectivity (FC) of the unseen subjects by leveraging a state transition Markov model. tMKL thus learns a mapping between the underlying anatomical network and the temporal structure. Training and testing were done using the rs-fMRI data of 46 healthy participants and the results establish the viability of the proposed solution. Parameters of the model are learned via state-specific optimization formulations and yet the model performs at par or better than state-of-the-art models for predicting the grand average FC. Moreover, the model shows sensitivity towards subject-specific anatomy. The proposed model performs significantly better than the established models of predicting resting state functional connectivity based on whole-brain dynamic mean-field model, single diffusion kernel model and another version of multiple kernel learning model. In summary, We provide a novel solution that does not make strong assumption about underlying data and is generally applicable to resting or task data to learn subject specific state transitions and successful characterization of SC-dFC-FC relationship through an unifying framework."

We addressed this problem by evaluating a directional measure between simultaneously recorded neurons from somatosensory thalamus (VPL) and somatosensory cortex (S1) sharing the same cutaneous receptive field, while monkeys judged the presence or absence of a tactile stimulus. During the stimulus-presence, feedforward (VPL→S1) interactions increased, while pure feedback (S1→VPL) interactions were unaffected. Remarkably, bidirectional interactions (VPL↔S1) emerged with high stimulus amplitude, establishing a functional thalamo-cortical loop. Furthermore, feedforward interactions were modulated by task context and error trials. Additionally, significant stimulus modulations were found on intra-cortical (S1→S1) interactions, but not on intra-thalamic (VPL→VPL) interactions. Thus, these results show the directionality of the information flow between the thalamo-cortical circuits during tactile perception. We suggest that these interactions may contribute to stimulus perception during the detection task used here."

Here, we analyzed neural population activity from the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats while the brain spontaneously transited through different synchronized and desynchronized states and intermittently received sensory inputs. We showed that cortical state transitions were determined by changes in stiff parameters associated with the activity of a core of neurons with low responses to stimuli and high centrality within the observed network. In contrast, stimulus-evoked responses evolved along sloppy dimensions associated with the activity of neurons with low centrality and displaying large ongoing and stimulus-evoked fluctuations without affecting the integrity of the network. Our results shed light on the interplay among stability, flexibility, and responsiveness of neuronal collective dynamics during intrinsic and induced activity."

Furthermore, does the assessment of non-chosen options continue after the decision has been made and the selected movement is already ongoing? Does the planning of several motor options depend on a unique parallel process or are there some elements within the sensorimotor loop requiring a sequential processing? Our hypothesis is that a change of available prospects at any point in time should dynamically adjust the desirability for each option, implying a fast reassessment of values and costs across prefrontal and motor cortical areas, even after an initial decision has been made and its associated response movement is ongoing. To test this, we performed a decision-making task in which human participants were instructed to select a reaching path trajectory from an origin to a wide rectangular target to gain the most reward. Reward delivery was contingent upon the distribution of value and upon precise target arrival. The original value distribution was altered during the ongoing movement in one third of the trials. Our results show that participants changed their movement trajectories towards the target position offering a better prospect, as presented by the second distribution. The changes of mind occurred more frequently for slow movements, had a duration in average inferior to the reaction time, and altered the initial timing and movement velocity. Although reward is the main factor guiding the selection of a specific movement in our experiment, our results indicate that the motor system was biased towards early changes of mind, given that the amplitude of the first acceleration and velocity peaks was significantly smaller in trials in which the participant switched target side and those in which they stuck to their original choice. Finally, the short latency of the recorded changes of mind strongly supports the hypothesis that, for the experimental conditions hereby considered, value considerations occur in parallel to motor planning."

The ventralmedial geniculate body, which provides the main input toA1, is in contrast able to respond to sequences with ratesupward of 200 Hz. This filtering of periodic stimuli hasbeen attributed to thalamocortical synaptic depression[1,2]. However, there also exists a frequency-selective fil-tering below 20 Hz known as differential suppression[3,4]. Such filtering produces a receptive field refinementin A1 neurons, rendering them more selective to the fre-quency of presented tones as the presentation rate isincreased.This phenomenon is thought to play a fundamental rolein auditory grouping (or auditory stream segregation,known as auditory streaming) phenomena, organizingsequential sounds into perceptual streams, reflecting dis-tinct ambient sound sources [5]. Here we propose a sim-ple model of A1 that can account for the differentialsuppression phenomenon. Our model has constraintscompatible with recent physiological findings in A1, suchas the approximate balance of inhibition and excitation[6,7], the presence of thalamocortical synaptic depression[1], and the role of intracortical and thalamocortical syn-apses in the formation of A1's activity pattern [8]."

Several studies have reported that aging changes the intrinsic properties of neural oscillations, both in resting state and in the context of cognitive tasks. For example, the amplitude of resting and motor-related beta band oscillations (16-25 Hz) is typically found to be higher in the older population compared to the younger population. Similarly, a substantial number of reports have highlighted that peak alpha frequency (8-12 Hz) is lowered in neurodegenerative disorders and in healthy aging. How such observations emerge from underlying neuronal signal processing mechanisms remains elusive. Furthermore, how do the spatiotemporal organization of these rhythms support the current neurobiological theories of aging is poorly understood. Here we addressed these issues using the resting state magnetoencephalogram (MEG) data from a large cross-sectional cohort consisting of 650 human participants with age range 18-90 covering the entire adult lifespan. Concurring with previous research in smaller cohorts, we found a consistent increase in the power of beta oscillations and a decrease in the peak alpha frequency as a function of age. Subsequently, we found significant posterior to anterior shifts in the spectral topographies of both alpha and beta bands. To reconcile these observations with a comprehensive theory at the level of network level signal processing, we computed the whole-brain global coherence that captures the degree of communication among nodes of a large-scale network as a function of aging. The global coherence among MEG signals increased with age in slower time-scales i.e. delta (1-3 Hz) and theta (3-7 Hz) frequencies. Simultaneously, global coherence decreased for faster timescales i.e. alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (16-25 Hz) frequencies. Further, using the measure of metastability that quantifies the divergence of a network from a stable synchronous state, we characterized the dispersion of information processing in different frequency bands. Putting together, our study reveals how neurobiological theories of aging such as posterior to anterior shifts of sensory and cognitive processing, dynamic workspace hypothesis can all be reconciled using resting-state MEG data. We could highlight how the temporal structure of MEG signals is representative of a more comprehensive understanding of large-scale network mechanisms that govern lifespan dynamics."

The human thalamocortical system is a densely connected network where local neural activation reciprocally influences coordinated collective dynamics. We introduce a semi-empirical model to investigate the relationship between regional activation and long-range functional connectivity in the different brain states visited during the natural wake-sleep cycle. Our model combines functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, in vivo estimates of structural connectivity, and anatomically-informed priors that constrain the independent variation of regional activation. As expected, priors based on functionally coherent networks resulted in the best fit between empirical and simulated brain activity. We show that sleep progressively divided the cortex into regions presenting opposite dynamical behavior: frontoparietal regions approached a bifurcation towards local oscillatory dynamics, while sensorimotor regions presented stable dynamics governed by noise. In agreement with human electrophysiological experiments, sleep onset induced subcortical deactivation and uncoupling, which was subsequently reversed for deeper stages. Finally, we introduced external forcing of variable intensity to simulate external perturbations, and identifiedthe key regionsespecially relevant for the recovery of wakefulness from deep sleep. Our model represents sleep as a state where long-range decoupling and regional deactivation coexist with the latent capacity for a rapid transition towards wakefulness. The mechanistic insights provided by our simulations allow the in silico parametric exploration of such transitions in terms of external perturbations, with potential applications for the control of physiological and pathological brain states."

The intricate topology of networks can also be investigated by means of the collective dynamics observed in the interactions of self-sustained oscillations (synchronization patterns) or propagation-like processes such as random walks. However, networks are often inferred from real data forming dynamic systems, which are different from those employed to reveal their topological characteristics. This stresses the necessity for a theoretical framework dedicated to the mutual relationship between the structure and dynamics in complex networks, as the two sides of the same coin. Here we propose a rigorous framework based on the network response over time (i.e., Green function) to study interactions between nodes across time. For this purpose we define the \emph{flow} that describes the interplay between the network connectivity and external inputs. This multivariate measure relates to the concepts of graph communicability and the map equation. We illustrate our theory using the multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which describes stable and non-conservative dynamics, but the formalism can be adapted to other local dynamics for which the Green function is known. We provide applications to classical network examples, such as small-world ring and hierarchical networks. Our theory defines a comprehensive framework that is canonically related to directed and weighted networks, thus paving a new way to revise the standards for network analysis, from the pairwise interactions between nodes to the global properties of networks including community detection."

The de-synchronization duration distributions exhibit power-law tails, characterized by the exponent in the range $1.1 < \tau_t < 2$, overlapping the in vivo human brain activity experiments by Palva et al. We show that these scaling results remain valid, by a transformation of the ultra-slow eigen-frequencies to Gaussian with unit variance. We also compare the connectome results with those, obtained on a regular cube with $N=10^6$ nodes, related to the embedding space, and show that the quenched internal frequencies themselves can cause frustrated synchronization scaling in an extended coupling space."
