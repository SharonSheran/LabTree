Many develop their regulatory activity in the thymus, but there is also evidence for development of Foxp3+ T reg cells from naive precursors in the periphery. Recent studies have shown that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β can promote T reg cell development in culture, but little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate this pathway under more physiological conditions. Here, we show that after antigen activation in the intestine, naive T cells acquire expression of Foxp3. Moreover, we identify a population of CD103+ mesenteric lymph node dendritic cells (DCs) that induce the devel opment of Foxp3+ T reg cells. Importantly, promotion of T reg cell responses by CD103+ DCs is dependent on TGF-β and the dietary metabolite, retinoic acid (RA). These results newly identify RA as a cofactor in T reg cell generation, providing a mechanism via which functionally specialized gut-associated lymphoid tissue DCs can extend the repertoire of T reg cells focused on the intestine."

The ability of pathogens to establish latency in immune individuals often has severe consequences for disease reactivation1,2,3. Here we show that the persistence of Leishmania major in the skin after healing in resistant C57BL/6 mice is controlled by an endogenous population of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells. These cells constitute 5–10% of peripheral CD4+ T cells in naive mice and humans, and suppress several potentially pathogenic responses in vivo, particularly T-cell responses directed against self-antigens4. During infection by L. major, CD4+CD25+ T cells accumulate in the dermis, where they suppress—by both interleukin-10-dependent and interleukin-10-independent mechanisms—the ability of CD4+CD25- effector T cells to eliminate the parasite from the site. The sterilizing immunity achieved in mice with impaired IL-10 activity is followed by the loss of immunity to reinfection, indicating that the equilibrium established between effector and regulatory T cells in sites of chronic infection might reflect both parasite and host survival strategies."

Therefore, we hypothesized that the gut environment preferentially supports extrathymic T reg cell development. We show that peripheral conversion of CD4+ T cells to T reg cells occurs primarily in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) after oral exposure to antigen and in a lymphopenic environment. Dendritic cells (DCs) purified from the lamina propria (Lp; LpDCs) of the small intestine were found to promote a high level of T reg cell conversion relative to lymphoid organ–derived DCs. This enhanced conversion by LpDCs was dependent on TGF-β and retinoic acid (RA), which is a vitamin A metabolite highly expressed in GALT.

When operating optimally, this immune system-microbiota alliance allows the induction of protective responses to pathogens and the maintenance of regulatory pathways involved in the maintenance of tolerance to innocuous antigens. However, in high-income countries, overuse of antibiotics, changes in diet, and elimination of constitutive partners, such as nematodes, may have selected for a microbiota that lack the resilience and diversity required to establish balanced immune responses. This phenomenon is proposed to account for some of the dramatic rise in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders in parts of the world where our symbiotic relationship with the microbiota has been the most affected."

IL-6 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) had been thought of as the principal inducers of TH17 differentiation, but this work provides further support for an alternative TGF-β-independent pathway of TH17 cell differentiation in mice. TH17 cells can be generated in the absence of TGF-β signalling by using IL-23 in combination with IL-6 and IL-1β. The resulting TH17 cells express not only RORγ-t, but also T-bet, and are more pathogenic than TH17 cells generated in the presence of TGF-β. These TH17 cells, generated independently of TGF-β, could be potential targets for the treatment of autoimmune disease. CD4+ T cells that selectively produce interleukin (IL)-17 (TH17 cells) are essential for host defence and autoimmunity. It has been thought that IL-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 are the factors responsible for initiating the specification of TH17 cells. Here, however, it is shown that TH17 differentiation can occur in the absence of TGF-β signalling. IL-6, IL-23 and IL-1β effectively induced IL-17 production in naive precursors.

Here, we show that disruption of the microbiota impairs the response of subcutaneous tumors to CpG-oligonucleotide immunotherapy and platinum chemotherapy. In antibiotics-treated or germ-free mice, tumor-infiltrating myeloid-derived cells responded poorly to therapy, resulting in lower cytokine production and tumor necrosis after CpG-oligonucleotide treatment and deficient production of reactive oxygen species and cytotoxicity after chemotherapy. Thus, optimal responses to cancer therapy require an intact commensal microbiota that mediates its effects by modulating myeloid-derived cell functions in the tumor microenvironment. These findings underscore the importance of the microbiota in the outcome of disease treatment."

Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is an 'alarmin', constitutively expressed at barrier sites and released in response to tissue damage where it recruits components of the repair response. This study in two mouse models of colitis shows that the IL-33 receptor ST2 is preferentially expressed on colonic regulatory T cells, where it promotes regulatory T-cell function and adaptation to the inflammatory tissue environment. IL-33 is negatively regulated by the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-23, suggesting that the balance between IL-33 and IL-23 could be an important controller of intestinal immune responses. FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) are abundant in the intestine, where they prevent dysregulated inflammatory responses to self and environmental stimuli. It is now appreciated that Treg cells acquire tissue-specific adaptations that facilitate their survival and function1; however, key host factors controlling the Treg response in the intestine are poorly understood. The interleukin (IL)-1 family member IL-33 is constitutively expressed in epithelial cells at barrier sites2, where it functions as an endogenous danger signal, or alarmin, in response to tissue damage3. Recent studies in humans have described high levels of IL-33 in inflamed lesions of inflammatory bowel disease patients4,5,6,7, suggesting a role for this cytokine in disease pathogenesis. In the intestine, both protective and pathological roles for IL-33 have been described in murine models of acute colitis8,9,10,11, but its contribution to chronic inflammation remains ill defined. Here we show in mice that the IL-33 receptor ST2 is preferentially expressed on colonic Treg cells, where it promotes Treg function and adaptation to the inflammatory environment. IL-33 signalling in T cells stimulates Treg responses in several ways. First, it enhances transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-mediated differentiation of Treg cells and, second, it provides a necessary signal for Treg-cell accumulation and maintenance in inflamed tissues. Strikingly, IL-23, a key pro-inflammatory cytokine in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, restrained Treg responses through inhibition of IL-33 responsiveness. These results demonstrate a hitherto unrecognized link between an endogenous mediator of tissue damage and a major anti-inflammatory pathway, and suggest that the balance between IL-33 and IL-23 may be a key controller of intestinal immune responses."

In particular, shutdown of interleukin 2 (IL-2) in the highly Th1 cell-polarized environment triggered by infection directly contributes to Treg cell incapacity to suppress effector responses and eventually leads to immunopathogenesis.

Furthermore, coinoculation of SGS converted B/6 mice into a nonhealing phenotype. No effect of SGS was seen in either IL-4– deficient or in SCID mice. Disease exacerbation in both BALB/c and B/6 mice was associated with an early (6 h) increase in the frequency of epidermal cells producing type 2 cytokines. SGS did not elicit type 2 cytokines in the epidermis of mice previously injected with SGS. These mice made antisaliva antibodies that were able to neutralize the ability of SGS to enhance infection and to elicit IL-4 and IL-5 responses in the epidermis. These results are the first to suggest that for individuals at risk of vector-borne infections, history of exposure to vector saliva might influence the outcome of exposure to transmitted parasites."

However, regulatory T cells also help limit collateral tissue damage caused by vigorous antimicrobial immune responses against pathogenic microbes as well as commensals. In this review, we describe various situations in which the balance between regulatory T cells and effector immune functions influence the outcome of host-microorganism coexistence and discuss current hypotheses and points of polemic associated with the origin, target, and antigen specificity of both endogenous and induced regulatory T cells during these interactions."

In C3H mice, anti-CD25–mediated T reg cell depletion before house dust mite treatment increased several features of the allergic diathesis (AHR, eosinophilia, and IgE), which was concomitant with elevated T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine production. In similarly T reg cell–depleted A/J mice, we observed a moderate increase in airway eosinophilia but no effects on AHR, IgE levels, or Th2 cytokine synthesis. As our experiments suggested that T reg cell depletion in C3H mice before sensitization was sufficient to enhance the allergic phenotype, we characterized dendritic cells (DCs) in T reg cell–depleted C3H mice. T reg cell–depleted mice had increased numbers of pulmonary myeloid DCs with elevated expression of major histocompatibility complex class II, CD80, and CD86. Moreover, DCs from T reg cell–depleted mice demonstrated an increased capacity to stimulate T cell proliferation and Th2 cytokine production, which was concomitant with reduced IL-12 expression.

We addressed whether parasites can directly induce T reg cells. Foxp3 expression was stimulated in naive Foxp3− T cells in mice infected with the intestinal helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus. In vitro, parasite-secreted proteins (termed H. polygyrus excretory-secretory antigen [HES]) induced de novo Foxp3 expression in fluorescence-sorted Foxp3− splenocytes from Foxp3–green fluorescent protein reporter mice. HES-induced T reg cells suppressed both in vitro effector cell proliferation and in vivo allergic airway inflammation. HES ligated the transforming growth factor (TGF) β receptor and promoted Smad2/3 phosphorylation. Foxp3 induction by HES was lost in dominant-negative TGF-βRII cells and was abolished by the TGF-β signaling inhibitor SB431542. This inhibitor also reduced worm burdens in H. polygyrus–infected mice. HES induced IL-17 in the presence of IL-6 but did not promote Th1 or Th2 development under any conditions. Importantly, antibody to mammalian TGF-β did not recognize HES, whereas antisera that inhibited HES did not affect TGF-β. Foxp3 was also induced by secreted products of Teladorsagia circumcincta, a related nematode which is widespread in ruminant animals. We have therefore identified a novel pathway through which helminth parasites may stimulate T reg cells, which is likely to be a key part of the parasite’s immunological relationship with the host."

The evolution of the dermal lesion could be dissociated into two distinct phases. The initial “silent” phase, lasting 4–5 wk, favored establishment of the peak load of parasites in the dermis in the absence of lesion formation or any overt histopathologic changes in the site. The second phase corresponds to the development of a lesion associated with an acute infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils into the dermis and was coincident with the killing of parasites in the site. The onset of immunity/pathology was correlated with the appearance of cells staining for IL-12p40 and IFN-γ in the epidermal compartment, and an expansion of T cells capable of producing IFN-γ in the draining lymph node. Parasite growth was not enhanced over the first 4.5 wk in anti-CD4-treated mice, SCID mice, or C57BL/6 mice deficient in IL-12p40, IFN-γ, CD40 ligand, or inducible NO synthase.

IL-15 is upregulated in the guts of patients with coeliac disease, and this new work points to a previously unknown involvement of IL-15 and retinoic acid in promoting an inflammatory immune response to gluten. The vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid is shown to act in conjunction with IL-15 to induce IL-12p70 production by intestinal dendritic cells, thereby promoting an inflammatory T-cell response to dietary antigens. The mechanism may underlie coeliac disease pathogenesis. Under physiological conditions the gut-associated lymphoid tissues not only prevent the induction of a local inflammatory immune response, but also induce systemic tolerance to fed antigens1,2. A notable exception is coeliac disease, where genetically susceptible individuals expressing human leukocyte antigen (HLA) HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 molecules develop inflammatory T-cell and antibody responses against dietary gluten, a protein present in wheat3. The mechanisms underlying this dysregulated mucosal immune response to a soluble antigen have not been identified. Retinoic acid, a metabolite of vitamin A, has been shown to have a critical role in the induction of intestinal regulatory responses4,5,6. Here we find in mice that in conjunction with IL-15, a cytokine greatly upregulated in the gut of coeliac disease patients3,7, retinoic acid rapidly activates dendritic cells to induce JNK (also known as MAPK8) phosphorylation and release the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12p70 and IL-23. As a result, in a stressed intestinal environment, retinoic acid acted as an adjuvant that promoted rather than prevented inflammatory cellular and humoral responses to fed antigen. Altogether, these findings reveal an unexpected role for retinoic acid and IL-15 in the abrogation of tolerance to dietary antigens."

The importance of our gut microbiota in health and disease is well established. Less clear is the role of the commensal microbes on the skin, where they interact with a tissue that, unlike the gut, is not designed for absorption. Here Yasmine Belkaid and colleagues examine the nature of the antigen presenting cells involved in the dialogue between the immune system and skin commensals. They find that defined skin commensal bacteria elicit a dermal dendritic-cell-dependent, long-lasting and commensal-specific CD8+ T-cell response, while preserving tissue homeostasis. The CD8+ T cells are shown to enhance innate protection against a fungal pathogen. The skin represents the primary interface between the host and the environment. This organ is also home to trillions of microorganisms that play an important role in tissue homeostasis and local immunity1,2,3,4. Skin microbial communities are highly diverse and can be remodelled over time or in response to environmental challenges5,6,7. How, in the context of this complexity, individual commensal microorganisms may differentially modulate skin immunity and the consequences of these responses for tissue physiology remains unclear. Here we show that defined commensals dominantly affect skin immunity and identify the cellular mediators involved in this specification. In particular, colonization with Staphylococcus epidermidis induces IL-17A+ CD8+ T cells that home to the epidermis, enhance innate barrier immunity and limit pathogen invasion. Commensal-specific T-cell responses result from the coordinated action of skin-resident dendritic cell subsets and are not associated with inflammation, revealing that tissue-resident cells are poised to sense and respond to alterations in microbial communities. This interaction may represent an evolutionary means by which the skin immune system uses fluctuating commensal signals to calibrate barrier immunity and provide heterologous protection against invasive pathogens. These findings reveal that the skin immune landscape is a highly dynamic environment that can be rapidly and specifically remodelled by encounters with defined commensals, findings that have profound implications for our understanding of tissue-specific immunity and pathologies."

Here, we show that expression of α E β 7 integrin is necessary for the homing of T reg at site of Leishmania major infection. The vast majority of T reg present in the dermis at steady-state conditions or during L. major infection express the α E chain (CD103) of α E β 7 . Genetically susceptible BALB/c mice that lack CD103 become resistant to infection, a phenotype that is associated with a poor capacity of T reg to be retained in the infected site. Such susceptible phenotype can be restored when T reg from wild-type mice were transferred in CD103 −/− mice. The central role of CD103 in T reg retention was further demonstrated by usage of blocking Abs against CD103 and the transfer of T reg purified from CD103 −/− mice. Our results strongly suggest that this molecule is induced and maintained on T reg following or just prior to their arrival in tissues. Furthermore, the expression of CD103 and the subsequent retention of T reg in tissues is highly regulated by their exposure to Leishmania Ag and the level of activation of the APCs they encounter. Thus, CD103, by controlling T reg retention, can contribute to the outcome of chronic infection by Leishmania ."

However, vitamin A deprivation paradoxically resulted in dramatic expansion of interleukin-13 (IL-13)–producing ILC2s and resistance to nematode infection in mice, which revealed that ILCs are primary sensors of dietary stress. Further, these data indicate that, during malnutrition, a switch to innate type 2 immunity may represent a powerful adaptation of the immune system to promote host survival in the face of ongoing barrier challenges."

Recently, a L. major model combining two main features of natural transmission, low parasite dose and inoculation into a dermal site, has been established in resistant C57BL/6 mice. In the present studies, C57BL/6 mice with CD8+ T cell deficiencies, including CD8−/− and CD8-depleted mice, failed to control the growth of L. major following inoculation of 100 metacyclic promastigotes into the ear dermis. The resulting dermal pathology was minor and delayed. Lesion formation in wild-type mice was coincident with the killing of parasites in the inoculation site. Both events were associated with the accumulation of CD8+ T lymphocytes in the skin and with the capacity of CD8+ T cells recovered from draining lymph nodes or infected dermis to release IFN-γ following coculture with infected dendritic cells. Reconstitution of resistance to L. major in RAG−/− mice using T cells from naive donors was optimal when both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were transferred. Primed CD8+ T lymphocytes obtained from C57BL/6 mice during the acute stage of infection were able to mediate both pathology and immunity when transferred alone. The low dose, intradermal challenge model reveals that CD8+ T cells play an essential role in both pathogenesis of and immunity to primary infection with L. major in the skin."

Reactivation can occur as a result of immunosuppression, environmental insult, or aging; however, the cause of reactivation of such infections is often not clear. We have previously shown that persistence of the parasite Leishmania major is controlled by endogenous CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T (T reg) cells. In this report, we show that despite efficient parasite clearance at secondary sites of infection, Leishmania superinfection can cause disease reactivation at the primary site. Our results strongly suggest that T reg cells, whose numbers increase in sites of reactivation, are directly responsible for such reactivation. Depletion of CD25+ cells at the time of secondary challenge prevented disease reactivation at the site of persistent infection while strengthening the expression of immunity at the site of secondary challenge. Finally, transfer of T reg cells purified from infected mice into chronically infected mice was sufficient to trigger disease reactivation and prevent the expression of an effector memory response. Our results demonstrate that after persistence is achieved, an equilibrium between T reg cells and effector lymphocytes, which can be disturbed by superinfection, controls the efficiency of recall immune responses and disease reactivation."

Regulatory T cells (T regs ), a CD4 + T cell subset usually characterized by high CD25 expression, control the intensity of immune responses both in rodents and humans. However, because CD25 expression does not define all T regs , especially in aged hosts, we characterized T regs by the expression of FOXP3, a transcription factor crucial for T reg differentiation and function. The proportion of FOXP3 + CD4 + T regs increased in the blood of the elderly and the lymphoid tissues of aged mice. The expression of functional markers, such as CTLA-4 and GITR, was either preserved or increased on FOXP3 + T regs from aged hosts, depending on the tissue analyzed. In vitro depletion of peripheral T regs from elderly humans improves effector T cell responses in most subjects. Importantly, T regs from old FoxP3-GFP knock-in mice were suppressive, exhibiting a higher level of suppression per cell than young T regs . The increased proportion of T regs in aged mice was associated with the spontaneous reactivation of chronic Leishmania major infection in old mice, likely because old T regs efficiently suppressed the production of IFN-γ by effector T cells. Finally, in vivo depletion of T regs in old mice attenuated disease severity. Accumulation of functional T regs in aged hosts could therefore play an important role in the frequent reactivation of chronic infections that occurs in aging. Manipulation of T reg numbers and/or activity may be envisioned to enhance the control of infectious diseases in this fragile population."

Since this early burst of IL-4 mRNA transcripts had previously been shown to instruct Th2 differentiation in mice from this strain, we examined the effect of PMN depletion on Th subset differentiation at later time points after infection.

Leishmania viannia braziliensis is the main etiologic agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Brazil, and it is also responsible for the more severe mucocutaneous form. Here, we investigated the possible involvement of Treg cells in the control of the immune response in human skin lesions caused by L. viannia braziliensis infection. We show that functional Treg cells can be found in skin lesions of patients with CL. These cells express phenotypic markers of Treg cells—such as CD25, cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated antigen 4, Foxp3, and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor—and are able to produce large amounts of interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor–b. Furthermore, CD4+CD25+ T cells derived from the skin lesions of 4 of 6 patients with CL significantly suppressed in vitro the phytohemagglutinin-inducedproliferative T cell responses of allogeneic peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy control subjects at a ratio of 1 Treg cell to 10 allogeneic PBMCs. These findings suggest that functional Treg cells accumulate at sites of Leishmania infection in humans and possibly contribute to the local control of effector T cell functions"

Mice vaccinated with AgDNA also harbored few, if any, parasites in the skin during the chronic phase, and their ability to transmit L. major to vector sand flies was completely abrogated. The durable protection in mice vaccinated with AgDNA was associated with the recruitment of both CD8 + and CD4 + T cells to the site of intradermal challenge and with IFN-γ production by CD8 + T cells in lymph nodes draining the challenge site. These data suggest that under conditions of natural challenge, DNA vaccination has the capacity to confer complete protection against cutaneous leishmaniasis and to prevent the establishment of infection reservoirs."

Inflammatory macrophages were obtained from nonimmune granulomas, initiated by the injection of polyacrylamide microbeads (Bio-gel P-100) into subcutaneous pouches of different mouse strains. Infection of inflammatory macrophages in vitro using metacyclic promastigotes produced identical effects on cytokine responses regardless of whether cells from genetically resistant or susceptible mouse strains were used: IL-12 was not produced in response to infection itself, virtually every infected cell lost its ability to produce IL-12 in response to IFN-γ/LPS, and the IL-6 response was partially inhibited, while the TNF-α response of infected cells was unimpaired. Low-multiplicity infection of inflammatory macrophages in vivo using either metacyclic promastigotes or tissue amastigotes also resulted in the complete and selective inhibition of IL-12 responses in infected cells. These data establish the physiologic relevance of prior observations regarding the selective impairment of IL-12 induction pathways in infected macrophages, and suggest a mechanisms for the delayed onset of cell-mediated control mechanisms that is typical of even self-limiting forms of leishmanial disease."

In this study, we have compared the depletion and repopulation of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + Treg in uninfected and malaria-infected mice using 7D4 and/or PC61 anti-CD25 Abs. We find that numbers and percentages of CD25 high cells, but not Foxp3 + cells, are transiently reduced after 7D4 treatment, whereas treatment with PC61 alone or in combination with 7D4 (7D4 plus PC61) reduces but does not eliminate Foxp3 + cells for up to 2 wk. Importantly, all protocols fail to eliminate significant populations of CD25 − Foxp3 + or CD25 low Foxp3 + cells, which retain potent regulatory capacity. By adoptive transfer we show that repopulation of the spleen by CD25 high Foxp3 + cells results from the re-expression of CD25 on peripheral populations of CD25 − Foxp3 + but not from the conversion of peripheral Foxp3 − cells. CD25 high Foxp3 + repopulation occurs more rapidly in 7D4-treated mice than in 7D4 plus PC61-treated mice, reflecting ongoing clearance of emergent CD25 + Foxp3 + cells by persistent PC61 Ab. However, in 7D4 plus PC61-treated mice undergoing acute malaria infection, repopulation of the spleen by CD25 + Foxp3 + cells occurs extremely rapidly, with malaria infection driving proliferation and CD25 expression in peripheral CD4 + CD25 − Foxp3 + cells and/or conversion of CD4 + CD25 − Foxp3 − cells. Finally, we reveal an essential role for IL-2 for the re-expression of CD25 by Foxp3 + cells after anti-CD25 treatment and observe that TGF-β is required, in the absence of CD25 and IL-2, to maintain splenic Foxp3 + cell numbers and a normal ratio of Treg:non-Treg cells."

Studying furin has been hampered by the fact that germline deletion of this gene is embryonically lethal. Here furin's physiological role in T cells is studied using a T cell-specific furin knockout mice. The striking finding is that conditional deletion of furin in T cells results in loss of peripheral tolerance and systemic autoimmune disease. Furin deficiency compromises TGF-β release and Treg function, and is associated with inherently more aggressive effector T cells. This research suggests that inhibiting furin may promote the immune response but may also cause the loss of peripheral tolerance by reducing levels of bioavailable TGF-β-1. Conditional knockout of the protease furin in CD4+ T cells is shown to result in impaired peripheral tolerance and autoimmune disease. Furin deficiency compromises TGF-β release and Treg function, and is associated with inherently more aggressive effector T cells. Furin is one of seven proprotein convertase family members that promote proteolytic maturation of proproteins1. It is induced in activated T cells and is reported to process a variety of substrates including the anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 (refs 2–4), but the non-redundant functions of furin versus other proprotein convertases in T cells are unclear. Here we show that conditional deletion of furin in T cells allowed for normal T-cell development but impaired the function of regulatory and effector T cells, which produced less TGF-β1. Furin-deficient T regulatory (Treg) cells were less protective in a T-cell transfer colitis model and failed to induce Foxp3 in normal T cells. Additionally, furin-deficient effector cells were inherently over-active and were resistant to suppressive activity of wild-type Treg cells. Thus, our results indicate that furin is indispensable in maintaining peripheral tolerance, which is due, at least in part, to its non-redundant, essential function in regulating TGF-β1 production. Targeting furin has emerged as a strategy in malignant and infectious disease5,6. Our results suggest that inhibiting furin might activate immune responses, but may result in a breakdown in peripheral tolerance."

Studies with NIH3T3 fibroblasts demonstrated that ninein is associated with the centrosome throughout the cell cycle and can also be detected within nuclei at interphase. At mitosis ninein was also observed in association with the mitotic spindle. Immunocytochemical staining of mouse tissues showed that ninein was expressed in a heterogeneous fashion.

Here, we report that a single acute infection can have dramatic and long-term consequences for tissue-specific immunity. Following clearance of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, sustained inflammation and associated lymphatic leakage in the mesenteric adipose tissue deviates migratory dendritic cells to the adipose compartment, thereby preventing their accumulation in the mesenteric lymph node. As a consequence, canonical mucosal immune functions, including tolerance and protective immunity, are persistently compromised. Post-resolution of infection, signals derived from the microbiota maintain inflammatory mesentery remodeling and consequently, transient ablation of the microbiota restores mucosal immunity. Our results indicate that persistent disruption of communication between tissues and the immune system following clearance of an acute infection represents an inflection point beyond which tissue homeostasis and immunity is compromised for the long-term.

A distinct ILC22 subset expresses the natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp46 (NKp46+ ILC22); however, the factors that contribute to the generation of this population versus other subsets are largely unknown. Herein, we show that T-bet (encoded by Tbx21) was highly expressed in NKp46+ ILC22, a feature shared by all NKp46+ cells present in the intestine but not by other IL-22–producing populations. Accordingly, the absence of T-bet resulted in loss of NKp46+ ILC22 in the intestinal lamina propria. The residual NKp46+ ILC22 present in Tbx21−/− mice showed a marked reduction of Rorγt expression and impairment in IL-22 production. Generation and functions of gut NK1.1+ cells were also altered. Bone marrow chimera experiments revealed a cell-intrinsic requirement for T-bet in these subsets and competitive reconstitution experiments revealed roles for T-bet in multiple ILC subsets.

We have shown previously that skin-dendritic cells (DCs) from both resistant C57BL/6 and susceptible BALB/c mice release IL-12 when infected with L. major , and infected BALB/c DCs effectively vaccinate against leishmaniasis. To determine if cytokines other than IL-12 might influence disease outcome, we surveyed DCs from both strains for production of a variety of cytokines. Skin-DCs produced significantly less IL-1α in response to lipopolysaccharide/interferon γ or L. major when expanded from BALB/c as compared with C57BL/6 mice. In addition, IL-1α mRNA accumulation in lymph nodes of L. major– infected BALB/c mice was ∼3-fold lower than that in C57BL/6 mice. Local injections of IL-1α during the first 3 d after infection led to dramatic, persistent reductions in lesion sizes. In L. major –infected BALB/c mice, IL-1α administration resulted in increased Th1- and strikingly decreased Th2-cytokine production. IL-1α and IL-12 treatments were similarly effective, and IL-1α efficacy was strictly IL-12 dependent. These data indicate that transient local administration of IL-1α acts in conjunction with IL-12 to influence Th-development in cutaneous leishmaniasis and prevents disease progression in susceptible BALB/c mice, perhaps by enhancing DC-induced Th1-education. Differential production of IL-1 by C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice may provide a partial explanation for the disparate outcomes of infection in these mouse strains."

Some common commensal gut bacteria that can cause spontaneous colitis—chronic inflammation in the colon—in susceptible individuals are well tolerated in others, but the reason for this difference is unclear. In this paper, the authors show that, in mice, the transcription factor c-MAF is required for the generation of Helicobacter-specific regulatory T (Treg) cells, which selectively retrain Helicobacter-specific pro-inflammatory T helper 17 (TH17) cells. In the absence of c-MAF or the c-MAF-induced cytokine IL-10, the bacterial-specific Treg–TH17 balance becomes impaired, and the animals develop pathobiont-dependent inflammatory bowel disease. The authors suggest that engineering non-pathogenic Treg-cell-inducing microbes that express pathobiont antigens could be a therapeutic approach to re-establishing homeostatic conditions in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, reducing the effects of the disease. Both microbial and host genetic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases1,2,3,4. There is accumulating evidence that microbial species that potentiate chronic inflammation, as in inflammatory bowel disease, often also colonize healthy individuals. These microorganisms, including the Helicobacter species, can induce pathogenic T cells and are collectively referred to as pathobionts4,5,6. However, how such T cells are constrained in healthy individuals is not yet understood. Here we report that host tolerance to a potentially pathogenic bacterium, Helicobacter hepaticus, is mediated by the induction of RORγt+FOXP3+ regulatory T (iTreg) cells that selectively restrain pro-inflammatory T helper 17 (TH17) cells and whose function is dependent on the transcription factor c-MAF. Whereas colonization of wild-type mice by H. hepaticus promoted differentiation of RORγt-expressing microorganism-specific iTreg cells in the large intestine, in disease-susceptible IL-10-deficient mice, there was instead expansion of colitogenic TH17 cells. Inactivation of c-MAF in the Treg cell compartment impaired differentiation and function, including IL-10 production, of bacteria-specific iTreg cells, and resulted in the accumulation of H. hepaticus-specific inflammatory TH17 cells and spontaneous colitis. By contrast, RORγt inactivation in Treg cells had only a minor effect on the bacteria-specific Treg and TH17 cell balance, and did not result in inflammation. Our results suggest that pathobiont-dependent inflammatory bowel disease is driven by microbiota-reactive T cells that have escaped this c-MAF-dependent mechanism of iTreg–TH17 homeostasis."

Shotgun metagenomic sequence analysis provides much greater resolution, elucidating multiple levels of microbial community assembly ranging from kingdom to species and strain-level diversification. We analyzed microbial temporal dynamics from a cohort of pediatric AD patients sampled throughout the disease course. Species-level investigation of AD flares showed greater Staphylococcus aureus predominance in patients with more severe disease and Staphylococcus epidermidis predominance in patients with less severe disease. At the strain level, metagenomic sequencing analyses demonstrated clonal S. aureus strains in more severe patients and heterogeneous S. epidermidis strain communities in all patients. To investigate strain-level biological effects of S. aureus , we topically colonized mice with human strains isolated from AD patients and controls. This cutaneous colonization model demonstrated S. aureus strain–specific differences in eliciting skin inflammation and immune signatures characteristic of AD patients. Specifically, S. aureus isolates from AD patients with more severe flares induced epidermal thickening and expansion of cutaneous T helper 2 (T H 2) and T H 17 cells. Integrating high-resolution sequencing, culturing, and animal models demonstrated how functional differences of staphylococcal strains may contribute to the complexity of AD disease."

To examine the role of LRG-47 in control of mycobacterial infection, LRG-47−/− and wild-type mice were infected with Mycobacterium avium, and host responses were analyzed. LRG-47 protein was strongly induced in livers of infected wild-type animals in an IFN-γ-dependent manner. LRG-47−/− mice were unable to control bacterial replication, but survived the acute phase, succumbing 11–16 wk postinfection. IFN-γ-primed, bone marrow-derived macrophages from LRG-47−/− and wild-type animals produced equivalent levels of TNF and NO upon M. avium infection in vitro and developed similar intracellular bacterial loads. In addition, priming for IFN-γ production was observed in T cells isolated from infected LRG-47−/− mice. Importantly, however, mycobacterial granulomas in LRG-47−/− mice showed a marked lymphocyte deficiency. Further examination of these animals revealed a profound systemic lymphopenia and anemia triggered by infection. As LRG47−/− T lymphocytes were found to both survive and confer resistance to M. avium in recipient recombinase-activating gene-2−/− mice, the defect in cellular response and bacterial control in LRG-47−/− mice may also depend on a factor(s) expressed in a nonlymphocyte compartment. These findings establish a role for LRG-47 in host control of mycobacteria and demonstrate that in the context of the IFN-γ response to persistent infection, LRG-47 can have downstream regulatory effects on lymphocyte survival."

Notably, natural killer (NK) cell-derived IFN-γ promoted a regulatory program in monocyte progenitors during development. Early bone marrow NK cell activation was controlled by systemic interleukin-12 (IL-12) produced by Batf3 -dependent dendritic cells (DCs) in the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).

We show that the Tec family kinase Itk (IL2-inducible T cell kinase), a component of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways, influences this balance by regulating cross talk between TCR and cytokine signaling. Under both Th17 and Treg cell differentiation conditions, Itk / CD4 + T cells develop higher percentages of functional FoxP3 + cells, associated with increased sensitivity to IL-2. Itk / CD4 + T cells also preferentially develop into Treg cells in vivo. We find that Itk-deficient T cells exhibit reduced TCR-induced phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) targets, accompanied by downstream metabolic alterations. Surprisingly, Itk / cells also exhibit reduced IL-2–induced mTOR activation, despite increased STAT5 phosphorylation. We demonstrate that in wild-type CD4 + T cells, TCR stimulation leads to a dose-dependent repression of Pten. However, at low TCR stimulation or in the absence of Itk, Pten is not effectively repressed, thereby uncoupling STAT5 phosphorylation and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Moreover, Itk-deficient CD4 + T cells show impaired TCR-mediated induction of Myc and miR-19b, known repressors of Pten. Our results demonstrate that Itk helps orchestrate positive feedback loops integrating multiple T cell signaling pathways, suggesting Itk as a potential target for altering the balance between Th17 and Treg cells."

Mice deficient in Tyk2 function have been previously shown to be resistant to autoimmune arthritis and septic shock but are acutely susceptible to opportunistic pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii . In this study, we show that Tyk2, in addition to mediating the biological effects of IL-12 and IFN-αβ, is an important regulator for the signaling and expression of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. In the absence of Tyk2, Ag-reactive CD4 cells exhibit impaired IL-10 synthesis following rechallenge of T. gondii vaccine-primed mice. The impaired IL-10 reactivation leads to unopposed antimicrobial effector mechanisms which results in a paradoxically superior protection of immune Tyk2 −/− mice against virulent T. gondii challenge. We further demonstrate that Tyk2 indirectly controls CD4 IL-10 reactivation by signaling for maximal IFN-γ secretion. The unexpected role of IFN-γ in mediating IL-10 reactivation by Th1 cells provides compelling evidence that conditions driving Th1 responses establish a negative feedback loop, which will ultimately lead to its autoregulation. Thus, Tyk2 can be viewed as a dual-function Jak, mediating both pro and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses."

Mammalian intestines are colonized by trillions of bacteria that help to maintain immunologic and metabolic health under homeostatic conditions, but that can induce effector T cell responses and inflammation under adverse conditions. Ronald Germain and colleagues use histocytochemistry to investigate the role of two major lymphoid-cell populations in the maintenance of immune homeostasis in the small intestine. They show that effector T helper 17 cells regulate the number of bacteria present in the small intestine, whereas regulatory T cells suppress the induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-23 by CCR2+ monocytes in response to stimuli from commensal bacteria. This process leads to downregulation of IL-22 production by group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) and subsequent activation of intestinal epithelial cells. In the absence of this adaptive immune effect, ILC3s remain constitutively activated after weaning, and the persistent production of IL-22 results in inflammation and abnormal lipid metabolism. The mammalian gut is colonized by numerous microorganisms collectively termed the microbiota, which have a mutually beneficial relationship with their host1,2,3. Normally, the gut microbiota matures during ontogeny to a state of balanced commensalism marked by the absence of adverse inflammation4,5. Subsets of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and conventional T cells are considered to have redundant functions in containment and clearance of microbial pathogens6,7, but how these two major lymphoid-cell populations each contribute to shaping the mature commensal microbiome and help to maintain tissue homeostasis has not been determined. Here we identify, using advanced multiplex quantitative imaging methods, an extensive and persistent phosphorylated-STAT3 signature in group 3 ILCs and intestinal epithelial cells that is induced by interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-22 in mice that lack CD4+ T cells. By contrast, in immune-competent mice, phosphorylated-STAT3 activation is induced only transiently by microbial colonization at weaning. This early signature is extinguished as CD4+ T cell immunity develops in response to the expanding commensal burden. Physiologically, the persistent IL-22 production from group 3 ILCs that occurs in the absence of adaptive CD4+ T-cell activity results in impaired host lipid metabolism by decreasing lipid transporter expression in the small bowel. These findings provide new insights into how innate and adaptive lymphocytes operate sequentially and in distinct ways during normal development to establish steady-state commensalism and tissue metabolic homeostasis."

Overall, both types of responses were significantly higher than in parallel experiments in which the same lipopeptides were delivered by the subcutaneous (s.c.) route. Moreover, the mucosal route resulted in the preferential induction of IFN-y producing T cells and of IgG2a antibody production, as compared to the dominant IL-4 and IgG1 responses obtained by the s.c. route, thus bringing a distinct advantage in the field of many infectious diseases and allergy. Possibly related to this Th1 response, we found that dendritic cells, the principal immune-competent cells to encounter antigens within mucosal membranes, take up lipopeptide antigens more efficiently than macrophages. Mucosal immunization by lipidated peptides appears therefore as a novel, noninvasive vaccine approach that does not require the use of extraneous adjuvant and which, besides cost-effectiveness, has attractive practical and immunological features."

As vitamin A is an essential nutrient, we evaluated retinoid levels in mice and humans after radiation-induced mucosal injury and found this conditioning led to an acute VAD state. Consequently, radiation led to a selective loss of both RA-dependent DC subsets and impaired class II–restricted auto and antitumor immunity that could be rescued by supplemental RA. These findings establish a critical role for RA in regulating the homeostasis of pre-DC–derived DC subsets and have implications for the management of patients with immune deficiencies resulting from malnutrition and irradiation."

Its use has been restricted or abandoned entirely, however, due to safety concerns. In an attempt to develop a leishmanization protocol that minimizes pathology while maintaining long-term protection, live parasites were coinjected with CpG-containing immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) alone or in combination with whole-cell lysates of heat-killed L. major promastigotes bound to alum (ALM). C57BL/6 mice infected intradermally by using L. major plus CpG ODN with or without ALM developed few or no dermal lesions and showed an early containment of parasite growth, while mice infected with L. major with or without ALM developed sizable dermal lesions that required up to 10 weeks to heal. The CpG ODNs provoked a transient inflammation that included an early recruitment and accumulation of gamma interferon-producing CD4+ lymphocytes in the site. Attenuation of the live vaccine did not compromise its ability to confer long-term immunity, as mice receiving L. major and CpG ODN plus ALM were totally protected against reinfection with L. major for up to 6 months. By comparison, the immunity elicited by two efficient nonlive vaccines began to wane by 6 months. Our results suggest that immune modulation using CpG ODNs might be a practical approach to improving the safety of a highly effective live vaccine that has already been widely applied."

In particular, outgrowth of γ-proteobacteria has been linked to the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease and the pathologic consequences of infections. Here we show that following acute Toxoplasma gondii gastrointestinal infection of mice, control of commensal outgrowth is a highly coordinated process involving both the host response and microbial signals. Notably, neutrophil emigration to the intestinal lumen results in the generation of organized intraluminal structures that encapsulate commensals and limit their contact with the epithelium. Formation of these luminal casts depends on the high-affinity N -formyl peptide receptor, Fpr1. Consequently, after infection, mice deficient in Fpr1 display increased microbial translocation, poor commensal containment, and increased mortality. Altogether, our study describes a mechanism by which the host rapidly contains commensal pathobiont outgrowth during infection. Further, these results reveal Fpr1 as a major mediator of host commensal interaction during dysbiosis."

To investigate the molecular mechanism of Treg diversity we used whole genome expression profiling and next generation small RNA sequencing of Treg cells isolated from type-1 or type-2 inflamed tissue following Leishmania major or Schistosoma mansoni infection, respectively. In-silico analyses identified two miRNA “regulatory hubs” miR-10a and miR-182 as critical miRNAs in Th1- or Th2-associated Treg cells, respectively.

Importantly, reduced miR-10a in Th1-associated Treg cells was critical for Treg function and controlled a suite of genes preventing IFNγ production. In contrast, IL-4 regulated miR-182 and cMaf in Th2-associed Treg cells, which mitigated IL-2 secretion, in part through repression of IL2-promoting genes.

We examined the expression of immunity at the site of secondary, low-dose challenge in the ear dermis to determine the kinetics of parasite clearance and the early events associated with the protection conferred by vaccination with live L. major organisms in C57BL/6 mice. Particular attention was given to the route of vaccination. We observed that the rapidity, strength, and durability of the memory response following subcutaneous vaccination with live parasites in the footpad are even greater than previously appreciated. Antigen-specific gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-producing T cells infiltrate the secondary site by 1.5 weeks, and viable parasites are cleared as early as 2.5 weeks following rechallenge, followed by a rapid drop in IFN-γ+ CD4+ cell numbers in the site. In comparison, intradermal vaccination with live parasites in the ear generates immunity that is delayed in effector cell recruitment to the rechallenge site and in the clearance of parasites from the site. This compromised immunity was associated with a rapid recruitment of interleukin-10 (IL-10)-producing CD4+ T cells to the rechallenge site. Treatment with anti-IL-10-receptor or anti-CD25 antibody enhanced early parasite clearance in ear-vaccinated mice, indicating that chronic infection in the skin generates a population of regulatory cells capable of influencing the level of resistance to reinfection. A delicate balance of effector and regulatory T cells may be required to optimize the potency and durability of vaccines against Leishmaniasis and other intracellular pathogens."

Therefore, Treg are a promising target for modulating immune responses to vaccines to improve their efficacy. Using a viral vector system, we found that Treg act on the developing immune response early postinfection by reducing the extent of dendritic cell costimulatory molecule expression. Due to this change and the lower IL-2 production that results, a substantial fraction of CD8+ effector T cells lose CD25 expression several days after activation. Surprisingly, such Treg-dependent limitations in IL-2 signaling by Ag-activated CD8+ T cells prevent effector differentiation without interfering with memory cell formation. In this way, Treg fine-tune the numbers of effector T cells generated while preserving the capacity for a rapid recall response upon pathogen re-exposure.

Immunologic studies involving experimental animal models of L. tropica infection are virtually nonexistent. In the current study, infectious-stage L. tropica were used to establish dermal infections in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. In both strains, the lesions were slow to develop and showed minimal pathology. They nonetheless contained a stable number of between 10 4 and 10 5 parasites for over 1 year, which were efficiently picked up by a natural sand fly vector, Phlebotomus sergenti . Control of parasite growth depended on the development of a Th1 response, as C57BL/6 mice genetically deficient in Th1 cytokines and BALB/c mice treated with Abs to IFN-γ harbored significantly more parasites. By contrast, IL-10-deficient mice harbored significantly fewer parasites throughout the infection. To further study the immunologic mechanisms that may prevent efficient clearance of the parasites, IL-10 and TGF-β signaling were abrogated during the chronic phase of infection in wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Distinct from chronic L. major infection, IL-10 blockade alone had no effect on L. tropica , but required simultaneous treatment with anti-TGF-β Abs to promote efficient parasite clearance from the infection site. Thus, chronic infection with L. tropica appears to be established via multiple suppressive factors, which together maintain the host as a long-term reservoir of infection for vector sand flies."

When the immune system encounters these noninvasive microbes, one possible result is the induction of cognate T cell responses that control various aspects of tissue function, including antimicrobial defense and tissue repair. Given the extraordinary number of antigens expressed by the microbiota, a substantial fraction of barrier tissue–resident T cells are expected to be commensal-specific, accumulating over time in response to successive exposure to new commensals. Because barrier tissues are defined by the constitutive coexistence of commensals and commensal-reactive lymphocytes, any understanding of tissue homeostasis, response to injury, and tissue-specific pathologies must occur in the context of this fundamental dialog. RATIONALE The skin serves as a primary interface with the environment and is consequently a constitutive target of environmental stressors mediated by physical damage or invasive pathogens. Tissue protection from these challenges relies on rapid and coordinated local responses tailored to both the microenvironment and the nature of the instigating injury. Our study explored whether commensal-specific T cells can act as tissue sentinels, allowing rapid adaptation to defined injuries, and how dysregulation of these responses may have pathogenic consequences. RESULTS Homeostatic encounters with commensal microbes promoted the induction of commensal-specific interleukin-17A (IL-17A)–producing T cells [CD4+ (TH17) and CD8+ (TC17)] that persisted as tissue-resident memory cells. Surprisingly, commensal-specific T cells were characterized by coexpression of classically antagonistic transcription factors (RORγt and GATA-3) that control the respective expression of type 17 and type 2 programs. Consequently, commensal-specific T cells displayed a hybrid chromatin landscape that underlies the coexpression of a broad type 2 transcriptome, including the type 2 effector cytokines IL-5 and IL-13. Notably, during homeostasis, RORγt+ T cells expressed type 2 cytokine mRNA without subsequent protein translation. By contrast, in the context of tissue challenges such as chitin injection or insect bites, commensal-specific RORγt+ T cells were able to produce type 2 cytokines (IL-5 and IL-13). The spontaneous release of type 2 cytokines by these cells was also observed in the context of local defects in immune regulation associated with impaired regulatory T cell function. Alarmins associated with tissue damage and inflammation, such as IL-1, IL-18, IL-25, and IL-33, were able to superimpose a type 2 effector program on both TC17 and TH17 cells in the context of T cell receptor engagement. Using an IL-17A fate-mapping strategy, we found that IL-17A–committed RORγt+ T cells and their IL-17A−RORγt+ counterparts both produced type 2 cytokines in response to tissue alarmins. Such cellular plasticity allows commensal-specific type 17 cells to promote IL-17A–mediated antimicrobial defense under homeostatic conditions, as well as tissue repair in an IL-13–dependent manner in the context of tissue injury. CONCLUSION Our work describes a tissue checkpoint that relies on the remarkable plasticity and adaptability of tissue-resident commensal-specific T cells. We propose that this feature may also have important implications in the etiology of tissue-specific inflammatory disorders. The extraordinary number of both commensal-derived antigens and T cells at barrier sites suggests that the ability of commensal-specific T cells to functionally adapt to injury may play a fundamental role in controlling tissue physiology."

We have analyzed the potential of L. major transgenic parasites, expressing the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA), to be presented by antigen-presenting cells to OVA-specific OT-II CD4+ or OT-I CD8+ T cells. Truncated OVA was expressed in L. major as part of a secreted or nonsecreted chimeric protein with L. donovani 3′ nucleotidase (NT-OVA).

Inoculation of mice with transgenic parasites elicited the proliferation of adoptively transferred OT-I T cells and their recruitment to the site of infection in the skin. Together, these results demonstrate the possibility of targeting heterologous antigens to specific cellular compartments in L. major and suggest that proteins secreted or released by L. major in infected DC are a major source of peptides for the generation of parasite-specific CD8+ T cells.

However, there are also major limitations, including conflicting results rooted in divergent microbiota among research facilities and the limited ability to predict the complex immune responses of humans. Recent studies have shown that conventional laboratory mice are too far removed from natural environmental conditions to faithfully mirror the physiology of free-living mammals such as humans. Mammals and their immune systems evolved to survive and thrive in a microbial world and behave differently in a sanitized environment. RATIONALE To generate a mouse model that more closely resembles the natural mammalian metaorganism with coevolved microbes and pathogens, we transferred C57BL/6 embryos into wild mice. This resulted in a colony of C57BL/6 mice, which we call “wildlings.” RESULTS Wildlings resembled wild mice and differed substantially from conventional laboratory mice with regard to their bacterial microbiome at important epithelial barrier sites (gut, skin, and vagina), their gut mycobiome and virome, and their level of pathogen exposure. The natural microbiota of wildlings were stable over multiple generations and resilient against antibiotic, dietary, and microbial challenges. Next, we delineated the immune landscape of wildlings, wild mice, and laboratory mice at immunologically important barrier sites (gut, skin, and vagina), a central nonlymphoid organ (liver), and a central lymphoid organ (spleen) by mass cytometry. Additionally, we characterized the blood immune cell profile by RNA sequencing. The differential contribution of microbial and host genomes in shaping the immune phenotype varied among tissues. Wildlings closely mirrored the wild mouse immune phenotype in the spleen and blood. Finally, we tested the translational research value of wildlings in a retrospective bench-to-bedside approach. This required well-documented, rodent-based studies that had failed upon transitioning to clinical trials in humans. We chose the CD28-superagonist (CD28SA) trial as representative for treatments targeting adaptive immune responses. Although CD28SA expanded anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs) in laboratory mice and showed therapeutic effects in multiple models of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, the first phase 1 clinical trial resulted in life-threatening activation of inflammatory T cells and cytokine storms. Similarly, the CD28SA treatment of wildlings, but not laboratory mice, resulted in an inflammatory cytokine response and lack of Treg expansion. As a representative for trials targeting innate immune responses, we chose anti–tumor necrosis factor–alpha (TNF-α) treatment (anti-TNF-α or TNF-receptor:Fc fusion protein) during septic shock, which was successful in animal models, but failed in humans. Anti–TNF-α treatment during lethal endotoxemia rescued laboratory mice, but not wildlings. Thus, wildlings better phenocopied human immune responses than did conventional laboratory mice in the two models studied. CONCLUSION The wildling model combines resilient natural microbiota and pathogens at all body sites and the tractable genetics of C57BL/6. Given the wide-ranging effects of microbiota on host physiology, natural microbiota-based models may benefit different research fields (e.g., metabolism and neurodegenerative diseases) and may also be applicable to other animals. Such models may enhance the validity and reproducibility of biomedical studies among research institutes, facilitate the discovery of disease mechanisms and treatments that cannot be studied in regular laboratory mice, and increase the translatability of immunological results to humans."

We observed that stimulation with NOD1 or NOD2 ligand had no effect on the survival/proliferation of hematopoietic precursors. Nonetheless, NOD1 but not NOD2 ligand induced expression of multiple hematopoietic cytokines (IL-7, Flt3L, SCF, ThPO and IL-6) from bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in vitro. Moreover, in vivo administration of NOD1 ligand to germ-free mice restored the numbers of hematopoietic stem cells and precursors in bone marrow as well as serum concentrations of IL-7, Flt3L, SCF and ThPO to the levels displayed by specific pathogen free control animals. Based on these findings we propose that NOD1 signaling in MSC serves as an important pathway underlying the requirement for microbiota in the maintenance of steady-state hematopoiesis. This function is distinct from that triggered by lipopolysaccharide in both its broad effects on multiple progenitors and specific targeting of MSC as cytokine producing intermediates."

Recombination activating gene 1 (Rag1)−/− mice, which lack adaptive immune cells, contained living skin-derived bacteria and bacterial sequences, especially mycobacteria, in their skin-draining lymph nodes. T cells from skin-draining lymph nodes of normal mice were shown, in vitro, to specifically recognize bacteria of several species that were grown from Rag1−/− lymph nodes. T cells from skin-draining lymph nodes, transferred into Rag1−/− mice proliferated in skin-draining lymph nodes, expressed a restricted T-cell receptor spectrotype and produced cytokines.

We generated a mouse model that recapitulated major features of this disease and used this model and patient samples to probe how hyperactive PI3Kδ fosters aberrant humoral immunity. We found that mutant PI3Kδ led to co-stimulatory receptor ICOS–independent increases in the abundance of follicular helper T cells (TFH cells) and germinal-center (GC) B cells, disorganized GCs and poor class-switched antigen-specific responses to immunization, associated with altered regulation of the transcription factor FOXO1 and pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family. Notably, aberrant responses were accompanied by increased reactivity to gut bacteria and a broad increase in autoantibodies that were dependent on stimulation by commensal microbes. Our findings suggest that proper regulation of PI3Kδ is critical for ensuring optimal host-protective humoral immunity despite tonic stimulation from the commensal microbiome. Patients who express a hyperactive mutant of the kinase PI3K exhibit defective humoral immunity. Preite et al. show that overactive PI3K leads to defective class-switched antigen-specific responses to immunization, despite augmented germinal-center formation and reactivity to commensal microbes and self antigens."

Whether the absence of Bim-mediated T-cell apoptosis can affect protective immunity remains unclear. Here, we used a mouse model of Leishmania major infection, in which parasite persistence and protective immunity are controlled by an equilibrium reached between parasite-specific gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-producing effector T cells and interleukin-10 (IL-10)-producing CD4+ CD25+ T regulatory cells. To further understand the role of Bim-mediated apoptosis in persistent infection and protective immunity, we infected Bim−/− mice with L. major. We found that the initial parasite growth and lesion development were similar in Bim−/− and wild-type mice after primary L. major infection. However, at later times after infection, Bim−/− mice had significantly increased L. major-specific CD4+ T-cell responses and were resistant to persistent infection. Interestingly, despite their resistance to primary L. major infection, Bim−/− mice displayed significantly enhanced protection against challenge with L. major. Increased resistance to challenge in Bim−/− mice was associated with a significant increase in the number of L. major-specific IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells and a lack of IL-10 production at the challenge site. Taken together, these data suggest that Bim limits protective immunity and that the absence of Bim allows the host to bypass antigen persistence for maintenance of immunity against reinfection."

Herein, we used single-cell analysis to explore the diversity of gene expression among lung lymphocytes during helminth infection. Following infection, we identified a subset of ILC2s that preferentially expressed Il5-encoding interleukin (IL)-5, together with Calca-encoding calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and its cognate receptor components. CGRP in concert with IL-33 and neuromedin U (NMU) supported IL-5 but constrained IL-13 expression and ILC2 proliferation. Without CGRP signaling, ILC2 responses and worm expulsion were enhanced. Collectively, these data point to CGRP as a context-dependent negative regulatory factor that shapes innate lymphocyte responses to alarmins and neuropeptides during type 2 innate immune responses."

How the immune system adapts to transient nutritional stress remains poorly understood. Here, we show that memory T cells collapsed in secondary lymphoid organs in the context of dietary restriction (DR) but dramatically accumulated within the bone marrow (BM), where they adopted a state associated with energy conservation. This response was coordinated by glucocorticoids and associated with a profound remodeling of the BM compartment, which included an increase in T cell homing factors, erythropoiesis, and adipogenesis. Adipocytes, as well as CXCR4-CXCL12 and S1P-S1P1R interactions, contributed to enhanced T cell accumulation in BM during DR.

Together, this work uncovers a fundamental host strategy to sustain and optimize immunological memory during nutritional challenges that involved a temporal and spatial reorganization of the memory pool within “safe haven” compartments."

The function of the GARP/LTGF-β1 complex has remained elusive. Here, we examine in vivo the roles of GARP and TGF-β1 in the induction of oral tolerance. When Foxp3(-) OT-II T cells were transferred to wild-type recipient mice followed by OVA feeding, the conversion of Foxp3(-) to Foxp3(+) OT-II cells was dependent on recipient Treg cells. Neutralization of IL-2 in the recipient mice also abrogated this conversion. The GARP/LTGF-β1 complex on recipient Treg cells, but not dendritic cell-derived TGF-β1, was required for efficient induction of Foxp3(+) T cells and for the suppression of delayed hypersensitivity. Expression of the integrin αvβ8 by Treg cells (or T cells) in the recipients was dispensable for induction of Foxp3 expression.

Here we addressed this question by using a skin graft experimental model where donors (H-2b or H-2d Tgβ-gal mice) expressed the mHAg like β-galactosidase (β-gal) in keratinocytes but not in Langerhans' cells (LC) which have an APC function. Rejection of Tgβ-gal skin by a β-gal-specific CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) effector mechanism should require presentation by donor and/or recipient LC of MHC class I-restricted peptides of exogenous β-gal shed by keratinocytes. Indeed, our results showed that 1) H-2b Tgβ-gal skin was rejected by H-2bxs and H-2bxd recipients; 2) rejection was mediated by β-gal-specific CD8+ CTL effectors; and 3) H-2bxd mice having rejected H-2b Tgβ-gal skin generated β-gal-specific CTL restricted by H-2b and H-2d class I molecules and rejected subsequently grafted H-2d Tgβ-gal skin in an accelerated fashion, demonstrating that recipient LC have presented exogenous β-gal-derived MHC class I epitopes.

Allergen induced production of the cytokine interleukin (IL-)4 by Th2 cells is central to the pathogenesis of allergic disease ( Gavett et al., 1994 ). The development of the G4 mouse, that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a surrogate for IL-4 protein expression has made it possible to directly track the immune cells that produce IL-4. By combining a reliable intradermal immunisation technique with the transgenic G4 mouse we have been able to develop a novel & unique in vivo primary Th2 immune response model (PTh2). When allergens relevant to human disease are evaluated using the PTh2 assay a dose dependent hierarchy of allergenicity is revealed with environmental allergens (cockroach, house dust mite) the most potent and food allergens being the least. In addition, the PTh2 assay is extremely sensitive to the immunoregulatory effects of Mycobacterial extracts and immunosuppressive drugs on primary Th2 cell development. Taken together, this assay provides a standardised method for the identification of the structural and functional properties of proteins relevant to allergenicity, and is a powerful screening tool for novel lead compounds that are effective at inhibiting the primary Th2 response in allergic diseases."

Early-life microbial colonization has been shown to play a fundamental role in the development of the immune system and imparts long-lasting effects on host fitness. However, despite the importance of this early host-microbiota dialogue, little is known about the microbial-derived signals and antigens involved. This question is of particular importance for mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, which are predominantly located in tissues colonized by the microbiota and characterized by their recognition of microbial-derived intermediates of vitamin B2 (riboflavin) synthesis. Because riboflavin synthesis is broadly conserved among bacteria and fungi, MAIT cells are thought to be particularly dependent on the microbiota. RATIONALE Although MAIT cells are the predominant innate-like lymphocyte subset in humans, there is remarkable variability in their abundance between individuals. How commensal-derived antigens contribute to the variability in MAIT cell abundance and their function has not been established. Furthermore, the extent to which MAIT cells promote tissue physiology remains to be determined. RESULTS MAIT cells were highly abundant within human and mouse skin. However, genetically identical mice housed in distinct cages showed striking variability in the proportion of MAIT cells. By contrast, animals in the same cage had similar frequencies of MAIT cells, supporting the hypothesis that these differences were associated with distinct microbiota. MAIT cells accumulated in barrier tissues between 2 and 3 weeks of age, bolstering the idea that MAIT cells develop during a very specific temporal window and in response to defined microbial exposure. The isolation of early-life intestinal commensals and subsequent colonization of neonatal germ-free mice with defined bacteria induced MAIT cell development. Conversely, colonization later in life failed to promote their development within tissues, indicating that microbial exposure must occur during an early-life window, imprinting MAIT cell abundance for life. Commensals that induced MAIT cell development were capable of synthesizing riboflavin, demonstrating antigen necessity, whereas the development of MAIT cells after treatment with a riboflavin derivative indicated sufficiency. After their development in response to early-life commensals, MAIT cells represented a dominant type-17 effector subset in the skin, and cutaneous MAIT cells distinctly expressed a transcriptional program associated with tissue repair. Cutaneous MAIT cells were tissue-resident and required the cytokine interleukin-23 (IL-23) for their homeostasis. These lymphocytes were capable of responding locally to skin commensals in a manner that required IL-1 and IL-18 as well as antigen presentation mediated by the major histocompatibility complex molecule MR1. MR1-mediated presentation of riboflavin metabolites was necessary and sufficient for MAIT cell recognition of skin commensals and further enhanced the tissue-repair program of these lymphocytes. Within the skin, MAIT cells were distinctly localized at the interface of the dermis and epidermis, in close proximity to the basal layer. Topical application of a riboflavin derivative selectively increased MAIT cells in the skin and was sufficient to promote cutaneous wound healing, demonstrating that MAIT cells contribute to skin physiology. CONCLUSION Our work demonstrates how early microbial encounters have long-term effects on the composition of the immune system. We show that MAIT cells are induced during a specific early-life window in response to riboflavin-synthesizing commensals.

RA acts on intestinal leukocytes to modulate their lineage commitment and function. Although the role of RA has been characterized in immune cells, whether intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) rely on RA signaling to exert their immune-regulatory function has not been examined. Here we demonstrate that lack of RA receptor α (RARα) signaling in IECs results in deregulated epithelial lineage specification, leading to increased numbers of goblet cells and Paneth cells. Mechanistically, lack of RARα resulted in increased KLF4+ goblet cell precursors in the distal bowel, whereas RA treatment inhibited klf4 expression and goblet cell differentiation in zebrafish. These changes in secretory cells are associated with increased Reg3g, reduced luminal bacterial detection, and an underdeveloped intestinal immune system, as evidenced by an almost complete absence of lymphoid follicles and gut resident mononuclear phagocytes. This underdeveloped intestinal immune system shows a decreased ability to clear infection with Citrobacter rodentium. Collectively, our findings indicate that epithelial cell-intrinsic RARα signaling is critical to the global development of the intestinal immune system."

Although the protective effect of CpG-containing immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides is clearly dependent on endogenous interleukin-12 and interferon-γ production, the source of these Th1-promoting cytokines in infected mice is unknown. In contrast to macrophages from Leishmania -resistant C57BL/6 mice, macrophages from susceptible BALB/c mice are hyporesponsive to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ. While studying interactions of various antigen-presenting cells with Leishmania , we found that BALB/c inflammatory skin macrophages, whether Leishmania -infected or uninfected, produced large amounts of interleukin-12 when treated with CpG-containing immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides. Like lipopolysaccharide, CpG-containing immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides induced production of interferon-γ and release of nitric oxide by skin macrophages. Studies using skin macrophages from interleukin-12- and interferon-γ-deficient BALB/c mice demonstrated that nitric oxide release was not dependent on interleukin-12 and interferon-γ production. Approximately 44% and 27% of intracellular Leishmania major amastigotes were killed by infected skin macrophages within 72 h upon stimulation with CpG-containing immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides and lipopolysaccharide, respectively. Parasite killing by macrophages was independent of endogenous interferon-γ production, but was strongly enhanced by exogenous interferon-γ. Parasite elimination was dependent on the induction of nitric oxide, however. In vivo , injection of CpG-containing immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides into lesional skin reduced the parasite burden ≈50-fold within the first 5 d of infection prior to full generation of a Th response. These results suggest that skin macrophages, constituting the principal reservoir of parasites in infected susceptible mice, produce Th1-promoting cytokines in response to CpG-containing immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides. In addition, CpG-containing immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides may also act locally on skin macrophages to facilitate Leishmania clearance by inducing nitric oxide production."

In this contribution, we first summarized informations which justify to develop in situ analysis to decipher the sequential events that result in different modes/classes of immune responses. How the mode of the immune response is determined remains a main question to address. Although it has recently become clear, in vitro, that immunocompetent cells and their cytokines are critical to set on a stable mode of immune response, acting on naive T cells, this area deserves more in vivo studies. Indeed, peripheral T cells, at different stages of differentiation, may exist in vivo (a) naive/virgin, (b) experienced, (c) effector T cells, depending on the level of stimulation of the immune system by either endogenous or exogenous (e. g. gut flora) signals. The three chosen examples illustrate our contributions in this field focusing on three different non-lymphoid tissues which may become infected: bone marrow (Bacille de Calmette Guerin), liver (Listeria monocytogenes), skin (Leishmania major).

Most antigens encountered by the immune system enter the body through the skin or mucosal surfaces of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tract. The vast majority of infectious microorganisms use these tissues as portals of entry. An additional feature of barrier tissues is their constitutive and ever evolving relationship with highly diverse and site-specific beneficial microbial communities referred to as the microbiota. Therefore, these tissues are charged with the formidable task of protecting the host from pathogenic challenges, while maintaining a peaceful coexistence with resident microbiota and preserving vital physiologic tissue functions. At these sites, failure to control responses can lead to severe inflammatory disorders including asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, or food allergies. The incidence of these chronic inflammatory diseases, as with most pathologies at barrier tissues, has risen significantly in the past several decades [1]. Understanding how immunity is controlled at barrier tissues as well as the key stressors of these environments is not only of major public health interest but is also the object of intensive investigation. The review series on Immunity at the Barriers published in this issue of the European Journal of Immunology highlights some of the key questions and recent findings associated with our growing understanding of how barrier immunity is regulated. In recent years, immunological research has evolved from a lymphoid tissue-centric view of the immune system to the integration of tissue microenvironments as a fundamental determinant of immune responses. This developing area of research has led to the growing understanding that one of the cardinal features of barrier tissues is their capacity to respond to defined challenges in a highly site-specific manner [2]. Maintenance of tolerance and restoration of tissue homeostasis following insults or exposure to pathogens rely on a complex and coordinated set of innate and adaptive responses. Such tissue-specific immune specialization relies on the capacity of defined and site-specific populations of immune cells to integrate local cues such as microbial products, metabolites, cytokines, or hormones. These tailored networks are essential to the induction of responses that preserve the physiological and functional requirements of a defined tissue. How epithelial cells, mast cells, innate lymphoid cells, dendritic cells, or lymphocytes control homeostatic barrier immunity and how deregulation of these responses leads to severe inflammatory diseases is the main focus of this review series. To maintain a homeostatic relationship with the microbiota and limit antigenic and pathogen exposure, protection is primarily mediated by an epithelial layer that forms a physical barrier and is supported by both adaptive and innate arms of the immune system. Over the past few years, it has become clear that epithelial cells via their capacity to produce mucus, antimicrobial peptides, metabolites, and cytokines are a central determinant of immunity in tissue microenvironments [3]. Expanding on this concept, the reviews by Lambrecht and Hammad [4], and Kurashima et al. [5] discuss how aberrant responses of gut or lung epithelial cells downstream from effector responses lead to the breakdown of tissue homeostasis and severe pathologies such as asthma or inflammatory bowel disease, respectively. Despite the specialization of each tissue and microenvironment, the expression of defined cytokines such as those coupled with Th17 responses is relatively conserved between barrier sites such as the lung, gastrointestinal tract, or skin. Indeed, via their capacity to act both on epithelial cells and to control inflammatory cells, IL-22 and cytokines of the IL-17 family contribute to both barrier homeostasis and immunity [6, 7]. In this review series, Way et al. [8] discuss the factors controlling the induction and function of Th17 cells in the lung and the link between uncontrolled Th17-cell responses and immunopathology. As discussed by Kurashima et al. [5], innate sources of IL-17 or IL-22, particularly from innate lymphoid cells, are required for barrier maintenance, tissue repair, and host defense. An important focus of the present issue is the role of defined populations of dendritic cells in the control of barrier immunity. In tissue microenvironments, particularly during inflammation, surface markers do not always faithfully distinguish subsets of cells. As discussed by Persson et al. [9], this polemic has recently been partially resolved by the development of a more ontogenetic definition of dendritic cell lineages [10]. The discovery that unique subsets of dendritic cells residing in tissues such as the gut are endowed with the capacity to sustain tolerogenic responses has helped shape our understanding of how barrier immune homeostasis is maintained [11]. However it has recently become apparent that this function can be contextual and that the same population of antigen-presenting cells can swiftly adopt a proinflammatory potential. Several lines of research also describe how, in tissues, the optimal induction of both regulatory and effector responses is more complex than initially postulated and relies on the coordinated action of several antigen-presenting cells. These concepts discussed by Persson et al. [9] highlight the specialization and functional plasticity of tissue resident dendritic cells. An important and growing line of research is the translation of these studies to the identification and characterization of the human dendritic cell network in tissues such as the gut or the skin, as highlighted in the review by Eynav Klechevsky [12]. Furthermore, as pointed out by Flutter and Nestle [13], our capacity to further understand the specificity of tissue responses not only relies on our ability to experimentally integrate the complexity of each tissue but also to devise models that closely mimic tissue-specific human pathologies. Collectively, this group of reviews serves to highlight the rapidly growing knowledge of the pathways and cell types that regulate immune cell homeostasis at barrier surfaces and spotlight some of the future challenges to be addressed in understanding barrier immunity in the context of infection, inflammation, and tissue repair."

Experiments in which infection is initiated with “supraphysiologic” numbers of parasites clearly identify Th-derived type I cytokines as essential participants in macrophage activation and macrophage nitric oxide production as prerequisite for parasite control. Dendritic cells, rather than macrophages, appear to be responsible for L. major -specific Th priming in these studies. Recent studies of murine cutaneous leishmaniasis in a model system in which infection is initiated with lower, more physiologic numbers of parasites confirm many of the important findings obtained in “high dose” inoculation models, but important differences have been noted. The low dose inoculation model should ultimately provide insights into mechanisms that are responsible for dendritic cell recruitment into leishmania lesions, mechanisms that facilitate parasite acquisition by skin dendritic cells and cellular interactions that eventuate in T cell priming and lesion involution."

In contrast to self-resolving infection in C57Bl/6 WT mice, Slpi−/− mice launch a strong Th1 response to L. major, yet fail to control infection and develop destructive, nonhealing lesions with systemic spread of parasites. Because SLPI is both produced by murine macrophages and antagonizes their function, we examined the contribution of macrophage polarization to the defective host response in the absence of SLPI. Slpi−/− and Slpi+/+ macrophages were first primed with either IFNγ or IL-4 to generate classically activated M1 or alternatively activated M2 macrophages. After infection with L. major, Slpi−/− M1 macrophages expressed elevated iNOS RNA, whereas arginase was more highly expressed in WT than Slpi−/− M2 macrophages. After in vivo infection, we found that both IFNγ and iNOS were persistently overexpressed in chronic lesions in Slpi−/− mice, but surprisingly, IL-4 and arginase concomitantly remained elevated. Moreover, overexpression of the negative regulators SOCS1 and IL-27 provided insight into the failure of IFNγ to clear L. major from the dermal lesions. Notably, adenoviral delivery of SLPI to L. major-infected Slpi−/− mice significantly limited the progression of infection. These studies suggest that convergence of M1 and M2 macrophage responses may influence the outcome of innate host defense against intracellular parasites and that SLPI is critical for coordinating resistance to chronic leishmaniasis."

However, studies in humans have produced varied conclusions, and the impact appears to vary widely depending on the helminth species present. To demonstrate how molecular approaches to the human gut microbiome can provide insights into the complex interplay among disparate organisms, DNA was extracted from cryopreserved stools collected from residents of 5 rural Kenyan villages prior to and 3 weeks and 3 months following albendazole (ALB) therapy. Samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the presence of 8 species of intestinal parasites and by MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Based on pretreatment results, the presence of neither Ascaris lumbricoides nor Necator americanus infection significantly altered the overall diversity of the microbiota in comparison with age-matched controls. Following ALB therapy and clearance of soil-transmitted helminths (STH), there were significant increases in the proportion of the microbiota made up by Clostridiales (P = 0.0002; average fold change, 0.57) and reductions in the proportion made up by Enterobacteriales (P = 0.0004; average fold change, −0.58). There was a significant posttreatment decrease in Chao1 richness, even among individuals who were uninfected pretreatment, suggesting that antimicrobial effects must be considered in any posttreatment setting. Nevertheless, the helminth-associated changes in Clostridiales and Enterobacteriales suggest that clearance of STH, and of N. americanus in particular, alters the gut microbiota. IMPORTANCE The gut microbiome is an important factor in human health. It is affected by what we eat, what medicines we take, and what infections we acquire. In turn, it affects the way we absorb nutrients and whether we have excessive intestinal inflammation. Intestinal worms may have an important impact on the composition of the gut microbiome. Without a complete understanding of the impact of mass deworming programs on the microbiome, it is impossible to accurately calculate the cost-effectiveness of such public health interventions and to guard against any possible deleterious side effects. Our research examines this question in a “real-world” setting, using a longitudinal cohort, in which individuals with and without worm infections are treated with deworming medication and followed up at both three weeks and three months posttreatment. We quantify the impact of roundworms and hookworms on gut microbial composition, suggesting that the impact is small, but that treatment of hookworm infection results in significant changes. This work points to the need for follow-up studies to further examine the impact of hookworm on the gut microbiota and determine the health consequences of the observed changes."

This mutation leads to a number of changes in T cells that result in altered cytokine production including increased IL-4 production, increased proliferation, and decreased apoptosis. Hyper-proliferation of the mutant T cells contributes to lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and multi-organ T cell infiltration. miRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that regulate expression of cohorts of genes. This study investigates which miRNAs are expressed in LAT Y136F T cells and compares these to miRNAs expressed in wild type T cells that are undergoing proliferation in two other settings. The first setting is homeostatic proliferation, which was modeled by adoptive transfer of wild type T cells into T cell-deficient mice. The second setting is proliferation in response to infection, which was modeled by infection of wild type mice with the nematode H. polygyrus. By comparing miRNA expression in these three proliferative states (LAT Y136F hyper-proliferation, homeostatic proliferation and proliferation in response to H. polygyrus infection) to expression in wild type naive CD4+ T cells, we found miRNAs that were highly regulated in all three proliferative states (miR-21 and miR-146a) and some that were more specific to individual settings of proliferation such as those more specific for LAT Y136F lymphoproliferative disease (miR-669f, miR-155 and miR-466a/b).

They support IL-2–mediated gene expression and the functions of the Treg-specific factor Foxp3. Accordingly, Treg-specific disruption of Thpok and Lrf causes a lethal inflammatory syndrome similar to that resulting from Treg deficiency. Unlike in conventional T cells, Thpok and LRF functions in Tregs are not mediated by their repression of the transcription factor Runx3. Additionally, we found that Thpok is needed for the differentiation of thymic Treg precursors, an observation in line with the fact that Foxp3 + Tregs are CD4 + cells.

The source of these cytokines, in our culture conditions, was CD44hi memory and/or effector phenotype CD4+ T cells. Several other papers have appeared on the topic, investigating the responsiveness of isolated naive cells to RA, a question of importance in understanding the molecular mechanisms that link RA to FoxP3 expression. This letter offers us the possibility to clarify the issue.RA could influence FoxP3 induction through several, nonmutually exclusive, mechanisms. First, an immediate and “direct” effect leading to activation of the FoxP3 locus, acting in naive T cells independently of any other influence (e.g., by direct transactivation of the Foxp3 locus or by potentiation of TGF-β signaling). Second, RA can inhibit the expression of the IL-6 receptor, thus dampening the sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of this cytokine; this mechanism has been demonstrated by Xiao et al. and ourselves (Xiao et al., 2008xXiao, S., Jin, H., Korn, T., Liu, S.M., Oukka, M., Lim, B., and Kuchroo, V.K.

Third, RA can shut down the synthesis of cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-21), which in concert have an inhibitory effect on FoxP3 induction. This is the mechanism shown in our previous paper (Hill et al., 2008xHill, J.A., Hall, J.A., Sun, C.M., Cai, Q., Ghyselinck, N., Chambon, P., Belkaid, Y., Mathis, D., and Benoist, C.

Experimental conditions in which naive T cells are stimulated in the presence of IL-6, of dendritic cells, or of other antigen-presenting cells do not address the point because they may read out mechanism #2 (e.g., experiments in Maynard et al. [2009]xMaynard, C.L., Hatton, R.D., Helms, W.S., Oliver, J.R., Stephensen, C.B., and Weaver, C.T. J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206: 343–357CrossRef | PubMed | Scopus (63)See all References]Maynard et al.

Some reports have shown direct responses of carefully isolated naive T cells (Xiao et al., 2008xXiao, S., Jin, H., Korn, T., Liu, S.M., Oukka, M., Lim, B., and Kuchroo, V.K. J.

Immunity. 2009; 30: 471–472Abstract | Full Text | Full Text PDF | PubMed | Scopus (96)See all ReferencesMucida et al., 2009). Yet, these inductions are carried out in conditions of T cell activation that can readily lead to effector cell differentiation, and thus to IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-21 production (over 4 days' culture). Indeed, cytokine-mediated inhibition of FoxP3 expression may well be at play in some of these “naive responder” experiments. The progressive inhibition of FoxP3 induction with increasing doses of anti-CD28, and its reversal by RA (Figure S1 in Mucida et al., 2009xMucida, D., Pino-Lagos, K., Kim, G., Nowak, E., Benson, M.J., Kronenberg, M., Noelle, R.J., and Cheroutre, H. Immunity. 2009; 30: 471–472Abstract | Full Text | Full Text PDF | PubMed | Scopus (96)See all ReferencesMucida et al., 2009), can plausibly be interpreted as cytokine production that increases with costimulatory signals. In the report of Xiao et al. (Xiao et al., 2008xXiao, S., Jin, H., Korn, T., Liu, S.M., Oukka, M., Lim, B., and Kuchroo, V.K. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 2277–2284PubMedSee all ReferencesXiao et al., 2008), RA treatment leads to increased Smad3 phosphorylation, and a known effect of IFN-γ signaling is the inhibition of Smad3 phosphorylation (Ulloa et al., 1999xUlloa, L., Doody, J., and Massague, J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710–713CrossRef | PubMed | Scopus (591)See all ReferencesUlloa et al., 1999).Thus, although the direct effects of mechanism #1 remain a possibility (and one suggested by the existence of an RAR-responsive element in the body of Foxp3 [Takaki et al., 2008xTakaki, H., Ichiyama, K., Koga, K., Chinen, T., Takaesu, G., Sugiyama, Y., Kato, S., Yoshimura, A., and Kobayashi, T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14955–14962CrossRef | PubMed | Scopus (100)See all ReferencesTakaki et al., 2008]), the interplay between RA and inhibitory cytokines mean that any claim that FoxP3 induction in naive T cells is directly influenced by RA must guard against the possibility of indirect effects, intercrine or autocrine.Ultimately, the in vivo situation is that which matters, and several mechanisms may contribute to the enhancement of FoxP3 expression by RA, in the multicellular menage that constitutes a lymphoid organ or tissue. But a clear understanding of underlying molecular routes will require reductionist in vitro systems, in which the inputs and secondary effects are carefully monitored and controlled."

Whether organ colonization plays a role in this shorter half-life is not known. We have previously shown that an intact whole-body microbiota can accelerate the kinetics of solid organ allograft rejection in untreated colonized mice, when compared with germ-free (GF) or with antibiotic-pretreated colonized mice, by enhancing the capacity of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to activate graft-reactive T cells. However, the contribution of intestinal versus skin microbiota to these effects was unknown. Here, we demonstrate that colonizing the skin of GF mice with a single commensal, Staphylococcus epidermidis, while preventing intestinal colonization with oral vancomycin, was sufficient to accelerate skin graft rejection. Notably, unlike the mechanism by which whole-body microbiota accelerates skin graft rejection, cutaneous S. epidermidis did not enhance the priming of alloreactive T cells in the skin-draining lymph nodes. Rather, cutaneous S. epidermidis augmented the ability of skin APCs to drive the differentiation of alloreactive T cells. This study reveals that the extraintestinal donor microbiota can affect transplant outcome and may contribute to the shorter half-life of colonized organs."

In clinical settings, shifts in skin microbiota composition have been shown in the context of skin inflammatory disorders, such as atopic dermatitis, acne vulgaris and psoriasis. However, the precise role of cutaneous microbiota in the initiation, control or promotion of skin inflammatory states remains unclear. To clarify the mechanisms by which the skin microbiota influence host immunity under inflammatory conditions, we focused on psoriasis, a common inflammatory skin disorder mediated by both innate and adaptive immune systems. Murine studies have shown that topical application of imiquimod, a TLR7 agonist, can induce psoriasis-like skin inflammation, mediated by the IL-23/IL-17 axis. Using this experimental model, we found that previous skin association of mice with C.albicans but not other skin microbes (e.g., S.aureus) , significantly enhanced skin inflammation. Notably, C.albicans topical association promoted IL-17A production from CD4+ effector T cells in the skin and skin draining lymph nodes. Our work currently explores how adaptive immunity directed against C.albicans could contribute to the etiology of this important skin disorder. This work aims to define the causative association between defined microbes and the development of skin inflammatory disorders and may allow for the development of tailored clinical interventions aiming at controlling skin microbiota and/or aberrant responses to these microbes."

Development of novel approaches toward enhancing endogenous immune responses against melanoma constitutes a critical step toward the management of disease. Of note, initiating immune responses against non-mutated melanocyte-specific protein antigens has shown efficacy in augmenting immunotherapies. Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease characterized by immune-mediated destruction of melanocytes, though the etiology of this disease remains poorly understood. Microbes have been recently found to have a profound effect on immune processes of the skin, including those that are associated with vitiligo progression. Identifying skin-resident microbes that initiate or exacerbate anti-melanocyte immunity, as well as the precise pathways that mediate these processes, may provide a novel framework for the development of immunotherapies to augment anti-tumor immune responses and efficacy of existing therapies. Thus, we have recruited a cohort of individuals with vitiligo and profiled their skin microbiomes at various body sites. We have found that vitiligo subjects harbor a skin microbiota that is unique from healthy subjects, and have isolated numerous vitiligo-associated bacteria. Furthermore, we have adapted a mouse model of vitiligo to understand mechanisms of host-microbiome interactions in this setting. Interrogation of this host-microbiome relationship may lead to the identification of novel targets and pathways by which to treat vitiligo and augment melanoma immunotherapies."

In this study, we have identified a requirement of the transcription factor Zbtb1 for the development of RORγt + ILCs (ILC3s). Zbtb1-deficient mice lacked NKp46 + ILC3 cells in the lamina propria of the small and large intestine. This requirement of Zbtb1 was cell intrinsic, as NKp46 + ILC3s were not generated from Zbtb1-deficient progenitors in bone marrow chimeras and Zbtb1-deficient RORγt + CCR6 - NKp46 - ILC3s didn’t generate NKp46 + ILC3s in co-cultures with OP9-DL1 stroma. In correlation with this impairment, Zbtb1-deficient ILC3 cells failed to upregulate T-bet expression, and to acquire IFN-γ production characteristic of NKp46 + cells.

This cell type plays a dominant role in contributing to the maintenance of homeostasis and in limiting collateral tissue damage caused by chronic effector cell responses to pathogens. Microbial infections could trigger the expansion and activation of natural Treg (nTreg) in several ways, some of which may not involve engagement of the nTreg specific T-cell receptors (TCR), although this latter event might facilitate responses. Only a few reports have focused on Treg during acute infections and some have concluded that regulatory cells have little influence on the outcome. Even when Treg successfully preserve homeostasis in the host by controlling excessive immune responses, one consequence of such control is enhanced pathogen survival and, in some cases, long-term pathogen persistence are provided in the chapter. Some pathogens may cause Tr1 induction by producing a homolog of IL-10, but these are chronic infectious agents and are discussed in the chapter. Although hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection does expand the Treg population, no compelling evidence shows that the extent of one or more types of Treg responses correlates with the eventual outcome of infection. Importantly, Treg purified from the lymph node of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients maintain their suppressive capacity against antiviral responses. The authors have evaluated whether or not manipulating Treg activity represents a useful way to modulate immunoinflammatory lesions caused by ocular infection with HSV."

Here, we report an IRAK1-containing SMOC formed specifically when multiple receptors are activated, which recruits select components of the TLR, MAPK and inflammasome pathways. This allows for signal flux redistribution from TLRs to inflammasomes and facilitates inflammasome licensing through an MKK7-JNK axis, which is defective in Irak1-/- mice. Furthermore, this defect in Irak1-/- mice manifests in increased susceptibility to inflammasome‑sensitive pathogens and diminished IL1 production from inflammasomes after co-TLR priming. Thus, IRAK1 SMOCs form a multi-pathway coordinating hub for coincidence detection of microbial signals, which may be employed by innate immune cells as a threat assessment and thresholding mechanism for inflammasome activation."

While microbial modulation of immune homeostasis has profound consequences for epithelial health and inflammatory skin diseases, the mechanisms of microbe-immune crosstalk in the skin are largely unknown. A key barrier to mechanistic work has been genetic intractability of one of the most prevalent skin colonists, Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis). Here, we develop a novel method to create a library of mutants with defined cell envelope alterations in primary human S. epidermidis isolates. By colonizing mice with these mutants, we uncover bacterial molecules involved in the induction of defined immune signatures. Notably, we show that under conditions of physiologic colonization, S. epidermidis cell envelope glycolipids are sensed by C-type lectin receptors, likely in non-myeloid cells, in conjunction with Toll-like receptors. This combinatorial signaling determines the quality of T cell responses and results in the potential for greater specificity toward commensal microbiota than previously appreciated. Additionally, the microbial molecules required for the colonization-induced immune response are dispensable for T cells responses in a model of S. epidermidis infection, but differentially modulate innate inflammatory responses. Thus, the same microbe uses distinct sets of molecules to signal to the immune system commensal versus pathogenic behavior, and differential sensing of these microbial signals depends on host context."

Clinically, TBI-conditioning prior to ACT has been associated with durable complete responses in nearly 40% of patients with metastatic melanoma. However, TBI-conditioning also leads to dose-dependent mucosal injury and significant weight loss in the majority of treated patients. To explore the potential immunologic impact of this acute metabolic and nutritional perturbation, we profiled circulating micro-nutrients in the serum of TBI-conditioned patients and tumor-bearing mice receiving ACT. Unexpectedly, we found that TBI induced an acute vitamin A deficient (VAD) state. Immunologically, this state was associated with a selective loss in the splenic CD11b+CD8α-Esamhigh (CD11b+) DC subset, the predominant DC subset in the spleen under steady state conditions which is specialized for class II antigen processing and presentation. By contrast, the CD11b-CD8α+ (CD8α+) DC subset, which is specialized for Ag cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells, was unaffected. Provision of exogenous retinoic acid (RA), the activated metabolite of vitamin A, restored the CD11b+ DC population following TBI. Further, evaluation of mice maintained on a VAD diet also demonstrated a CD11b+ DC defect that could be rescued by RA add-back, confirming that vitamin A is required in the physiologic maintenance of the CD11b+ subset. Mechanistically, VAD did not impair the formation of pre-DCs, the immediate hematopoetic progenitor of both the CD11b+ and CD8α+ DC subsets. Rather, in fate-tracking experiments, transfer of pre-DC into RA-supplemented hosts resulted in near complete conversion into the CD11b+ subset whereas transfer into VAD hosts caused diversion to the CD8α+lineage. Functionally, TBI-induced vitamin A deficiency resulted in impaired antitumor immunity mediated by ACT of CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells which could be rescued by supplemental RA. These findings establish a critical role for vitamin A in regulating the homeostasis of pre-DC derived DC subsets. Moreover, these data demonstrate how the nutritional and metabolic status of the tumor-hearing host can have a profound influence on therapeutic outcomes to vaccine and adoptive T cell immunotherapies."

CD300f (CLM-1), a cell surface receptor that recognizes phosphatidylserine exposed on apoptotic cells, has been shown to promote efferocytosis by macrophages. In the present study, we found that CD300f plays a critical role in controlling the severity and duration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and CD300f-expressing macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) were identified as key players controlling disease pathogenesis. Compared to Cd300f+/+ mice, Cd300f-/- mice showed increased susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis and impaired resolution of inflammation. In Cd300f-/- mice, macrophage-mediated efferocytosis was reduced, resulting in apoptotic cell accumulation in the gut mucosa. In contrast, Cd300f-/- DC engulfed apoptotic cells more efficiently than Cd300f+/+ DC. CD300f-deficient DC transfer exacerbated DSS-induced inflammation and delayed its resolution, whereas CD300f-expressing macrophage transfer attenuated DSS-induced inflammation. Hyperactive efferocytosis by CD300f-deficient gut DC resulted in excessive tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) secretion, which induced secondary interferon-a (IFN-a) over-production, both of which impaired the resolution of colitis. TNF-a neutralization resulted in decreased levels of gut pro-inflammatory cytokines and significant disease amelioration. Collectively, these results suggest that CD300f is important for preventing chronic inflammation by enhancing macrophage efferocytosis and inhibiting TNF-a production induced by DC efferocytosis. From these findings, it is conceivable that increasing macrophage-mediated efferocytosis and suppressing DC-mediated efferocytosis through upregulation of CD300f expression would provide a new therapeutic strategy for inflammatory bowel disease patients.

Here we show that application of distinct human commensals to the skin of mice induces the accumulation of IL-17A-producing T cells in the lungs. The induction of these cells occurs in a manner that is partially dependent on both antigen presentation and IL-23 signaling. Response kinetics and adoptive transfer experiments suggest that the T cells migrate from the skin-draining lymph nodes, while transcriptional analysis has identified specific chemokine receptors that may facilitate trafficking to the lungs. Furthermore, in the context of pulmonary infection, cutaneous application of commensals promotes the production of IL-17A and recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs. This work demonstrates that the skin microbiome can enhance pulmonary immunity, but also has the potential to exacerbate inflammation through the production of IL-17A, thus providing a possible mechanism for why children with atopic dermatitis have an increased propensity to develop asthma, a progression commonly referred to as the “atopic march.”"

Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease characterized by immune-mediated destruction of melanocytes, though the etiology of this disease remains poorly understood. Microbes have been recently found to have a profound effect on immune processes of the skin, including those that are associated with vitiligo progression.

Cellular analyses characterized transient changes in T cell polarization and more persistent alterations in T and B cell subset frequencies and activation. Serum proteomic analysis identified a potentially novel set of 7 proteins that are predictive of gestational age: DDR1, PLAU, MRC1, ACP5, ROBO2, IGF2R, and GNS. We further show that gestational age can be predicted from the parameters obtained by complete blood count tests and clinical flow cytometry characterizing 5 major immune cell populations. Inferring gestational age from this routine clinical phenotyping data could be useful in resource-limited settings that lack obstetric ultrasound. Overall, both the cellular and proteomic analyses validate previously reported phenotypic immunological changes of pregnancy and uncover potentially new alterations and predictive markers."

The diverse array of commensal microorganisms that reside at barrier sites of the human body, collectively termed the microbiome, provide the primary source of constitutive microbial stimulation and promote immune homeostasis through their release of microbial products, including derivatives of vitamin synthesis. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are unconventional T-cells that recognize microbial-derived metabolites and provide an initial defense to pathogens through their rapid production of type-1 or type-17 cytokines. While MAIT-cells have been shown to infiltrate colorectal tumors, it remains to be determined how MAIT-cells contribute to tumorigenesis and whether commensals regulate MAIT-cell function. Here we show that MAIT-cells are a substantial skin-resident population capable of producing IL-17A. IL-23 signaling promotes the accumulation of cutaneous MAIT-cells and skin commensals induce local MAIT-cell proliferation and IL-1-dependent IL-17A production. In the absence of commensals, MAIT-cells are dramatically decreased, indicating that the microbiota is necessary for the development of this population. Utilizing MAIT-cell-deficient mice, we demonstrate that cutaneous MAIT-cells promote wound healing and inhibit the colonization of pathogens. This work identifies MAIT-cells as the only cell population that is entirely dependent on the microbiota and reveals the mechanism by which these cells respond to the commensal microbial community. Since IL-17A promotes tumor vascularization and neutrophil recruitment, the high frequency of MAIT-cells in human skin suggests that modulation of the skin-resident bacteria may have clinical applications for the progression of melanoma, and current studies are exploring this possibility using the B16 melanoma model in mice.This work was supported by the NIH Intramural Research Program.

The microbiome consists of a diverse array of commensal microorganisms that reside at barrier sites of the human body and promote local immune homeostasis, but also provide the primary source of constitutive microbial stimulation. While recent work has demonstrated that intestinal commensals can influence immunity throughout the body, the distal effects of other microbial communities have not been fully explored. Here we show that application of distinct human commensals to the skin of mice induces the accumulation of IL-17A-producing T cells in the lungs. The induction of these cells occurs in a manner that is partially dependent on both antigen presentation and IL-23 signaling. Response kinetics and adoptive transfer experiments suggest that the T cells migrate from the skin-draining lymph nodes, while transcriptional analysis has identified specific chemokine receptors that facilitate trafficking to the lungs. Furthermore, in the context of a pulmonary challenge, cutaneous application of commensals promotes the production of IL-17A and recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs. This work demonstrates that the skin microbiome can enhance pulmonary immunity, but also has the potential to cause pro-oncogenic inflammation. Since IL-17A promotes tumor vascularization and neutrophils can contribute to the establishment of metastases, specific microbes at distal sites such as the skin may exacerbate the progression of lung cancer.

However, regulatory T cells also help limit collateral tissue damage caused by vigorous antimicrobial immune responses against pathogenic microbes as well as commensals.

Leishmania viannia braziliensis is the main etiologic agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Brazil, and it is also responsible for the more severe mucocutaneous form. Here, we investigated the possible involvement of Treg cells in the control of the immune response in human skin lesions caused by L. viannia braziliensis infection. We show that functional Treg cells can be found in skin lesions of patients with CL. These cells express phenotypic markers of Treg cells—such as CD25, cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated antigen 4, Foxp3, and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor—and are able to produce large amounts of interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor–b. Furthermore, CD4 + CD25 + T cells derived from the skin lesions of 4 of 6 patients with CL significantly suppressed in vitro the phytohemagglutinin-induced proliferative T cell responses of allogeneic peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy control subjects at ar atio of 1T reg cell to 10 allogeneic PBMCs. These findings suggest that functional Treg cells accumulate at sites of Leishmania infection in humans and possibly contribute to the local control of effector T cell functions."

Our studies addressed the antigenic specifi city of natural T reg cells that accumulate at sites of chronic infection with Leishmania major in mice. Our results support the idea that natural T reg cells are able to respond specifi cally to foreign antigens in that they strongly proliferate in response to Leishmania-infected dendritic cells, they maintain Foxp3 expression, and Leishmania-specifi c T reg cell lines can be generated from infected mice.

We explore the impact of T reg cell depletion on the allergic response in mice susceptible (A/J) or comparatively resistant (C3H) to the development of allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). In C3H mice, anti-CD25‐mediated T reg cell depletion before house dust mite treatment increased several features of the allergic diathesis (AHR, eosinophilia, and IgE), which was concomitant with elevated T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine production. In similarly T reg cell‐depleted A/J mice, we observed a moderate increase in airway eosinophilia but no effects on AHR, IgE levels, or Th2 cytokine synthesis. As our experiments suggested that T reg cell depletion in C3H mice before sensitization was sufficient to enhance the allergic phenotype, we characterized dendritic cells (DCs) in T reg cell‐depleted C3H mice. T reg cell‐depleted mice had increased numbers of pulmonary myeloid DCs with elevated expression of major histocompatibility complex class II, CD80, and CD86. Moreover, DCs from T reg cell‐depleted mice demonstrated an increased capacity to stimulate T cell proliferation and Th2 cytokine production, which was concomitant with reduced IL-12 expression.
