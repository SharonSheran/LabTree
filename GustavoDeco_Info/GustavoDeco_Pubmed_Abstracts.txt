Healthy ageing is accompanied by changes to spontaneous electromagnetic
oscillations. At the macroscopic scale, previous studies have quantified the
basic features, e.g., power and frequencies in rhythms of interest from the
perspective of attention, perception, learning and memory. On the other hand,
signatures and modes of neural communication have recently been argued to be
identifiable from global measures applied on neuro-electromagnetic data such as
global coherence that quantifies the degree of togetherness of distributed neural
oscillations and metastability that parametrizes the transient dynamics of the
network switching between successive stable states. Here, we demonstrate that
global coherence and metastability can be informative measures to track healthy
ageing dynamics over lifespan and together with the traditional spectral measures
provides an attractive explanation of neuronal information processing. Finding
normative patterns of brain rhythms in resting state MEG would naturally pave the
way for tracking task relevant metrics that could crucially determine cognitive
flexibility and performance. While previously reported observations of a
reduction in peak alpha frequency and increased beta power in older adults are
reflective of changes at individual sensors (during rest and task), global
coherence and metastability truly pinpoint the underlying coordination dynamics
over multiple brain areas across the entire lifespan. In addition to replication 
of the previous observations in a substantially larger lifespan cohort than what 
was previously reported, we also demonstrate, for the first time to the best of
our knowledge, age related changes in coherence and metastability in signals over
time scales of neuronal processing. Furthermore, we observed a marked frequency
dependence in changes in global coordination dynamics, which, coupled with the
long-held view of specific frequency bands sub-serving different aspects of
cognition, hints at differential functional processing roles for slower and
faster brain dynamics.

Global brain states are frequently placed within a unidimensional continuum by
correlational studies, ranging from states of deep unconsciousness to ordinary
wakefulness. An alternative is their multidimensional and mechanistic
characterization in terms of different cognitive capacities, using computational 
models to reproduce the underlying neural dynamics. We explore this alternative
by introducing a semi-empirical model linking regional activation and long-range 
functional connectivity in the different brain states visited during the natural 
wake-sleep cycle. Our model combines functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
data, in vivo estimates of structural connectivity, and anatomically-informed
priors to constrain the independent variation of regional activation. The best
fit to empirical data was achieved using priors based on functionally coherent
networks, with the resulting model parameters dividing the cortex into regions
presenting opposite dynamical behavior. Frontoparietal regions approached a
bifurcation from dynamics at a fixed point governed by noise, while sensorimotor 
regions approached a bifurcation from oscillatory dynamics. In agreement with
human electrophysiological experiments, sleep onset induced subcortical
deactivation with low correlation, which was subsequently reversed for deeper
stages. Finally, we introduced periodic forcing of variable intensity to simulate
external perturbations, and identified the key regions relevant for the recovery 
of wakefulness from deep sleep. Our model represents sleep as a state with
diminished perceptual gating and the latent capacity for global accessibility
that is required for rapid arousals. To the extent that the qualitative
characterization of local dynamics is exhausted by the dichotomy between unstable
and stable behavior, our work highlights how expanding the model parameter space 
can describe states of consciousness in terms of multiple dimensions with
interpretations given by the choice of anatomically-informed priors.

Remarkable progress has come from whole-brain models linking anatomy and
function. Paradoxically, it is not clear how a neuronal dynamical system running 
in the fixed human anatomical connectome can give rise to the rich changes in the
functional repertoire associated with human brain function, which is impossible
to explain through long-term plasticity. Neuromodulation evolved to allow for
such flexibility by dynamically updating the effectivity of the fixed anatomical 
connectivity. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework modeling the dynamical
mutual coupling between the neuronal and neurotransmitter systems. We demonstrate
that this framework is crucial to advance our understanding of whole-brain
dynamics by bidirectional coupling of the two systems through combining
multimodal neuroimaging data (diffusion magnetic resonance imaging [dMRI],
functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI], and positron electron tomography
[PET]) to explain the functional effects of specific serotoninergic receptor
(5-HT2AR) stimulation with psilocybin in healthy humans. This advance provides an
understanding of why psilocybin is showing considerable promise as a therapeutic 
intervention for neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and
addiction. Overall, these insights demonstrate that the whole-brain mutual
coupling between the neuronal and the neurotransmission systems is essential for 
understanding the remarkable flexibility of human brain function despite having
to rely on fixed anatomical connectivity.

Previous research showed that spontaneous neuronal activity presents sloppiness: 
the collective behavior is strongly determined by a small number of parameter
combinations, defined as 'stiff' dimensions, while it is insensitive to many
others ('sloppy' dimensions). Here, we analyzed neural population activity from
the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats while the brain spontaneously transited 
through different synchronized and desynchronized states and intermittently
received sensory inputs. We showed that cortical state transitions were
determined by changes in stiff parameters associated with the activity of a core 
of neurons with low responses to stimuli and high centrality within the observed 
network. In contrast, stimulus-evoked responses evolved along sloppy dimensions
associated with the activity of neurons with low centrality and displaying large 
ongoing and stimulus-evoked fluctuations without affecting the integrity of the
network. Our results shed light on the interplay among stability, flexibility,
and responsiveness of neuronal collective dynamics during intrinsic and induced
activity.

The spatial mapping of localized events in brain activity critically depends on
the correct identification of the pattern signatures associated with those
events. For instance, in the context of epilepsy research, a number of different 
electrophysiological patterns have been associated with epileptogenic activity.
Motivated by the need to define automated seizure focus detectors, we propose a
novel data-driven algorithm for the spatial identification of localized events
that is based on the following rationale: the distribution of emerging
oscillations during confined events across all recording sites is highly
non-uniform and can be mapped using a spatial entropy function. By applying this 
principle to EEG recording obtained from 67 distinct seizure epochs, our method
successfully identified the seizure focus on a group of ten drug-resistant
temporal lobe epilepsy patients (average sensitivity: 0.94, average specificity: 
0.90) together with its characteristic electrophysiological pattern signature.
Cross-validation of the method outputs with postresective information revealed
the consistency of our findings in long follow-up seizure-free patients. Overall,
our methodology provides a reliable computational procedure that might be used as
in both experimental and clinical domains to identify the neural populations
undergoing an emerging functional or pathological transition.

Neuroimaging-based personalized medicine is emerging to characterize brain
disorders and their evolution at the patient level. In this chapter, we present
the most classic methods used to infer large-scale brain connectivity based on
functional MRI. We adopt a modeling perspective where every connectivity measure 
is linked to a specific model that allows to interpret the connectivity estimate.
This perspective allows to analyze the quality of retrieved connectivity profiles
in terms of modeling error and estimation error. In the first part of the
chapter, we present undirected functional connectivity (Pearson's correlation and
MI) and effective connectivity (partial correlation), as well as directed
effective connectivity (VAR, MOU, Granger causality, DCM). In addition, some of
these measures correspond to fully connected graphs (Pearson's correlation) while
others to sparse ones (MOU, DCM), where the sparsity can come from the
integration of functional and structural data. In the second part, we claim that 
machine learning tools are better suited than null-hypothesis testing to link the
estimated connectomes with diagnosis and prognosis of neuropsychiatric diseases. 
Finally, we propose that linear models and features selection are preferable to
more complex and nonlinear tools (when prediction performance is on a par) for
building interpretable algorithms to predict clinical variables.

The aim was to go beyond functional connectivity, by measuring in the first
large-scale study differences in effective, that is directed, connectivity
between brain areas in autism compared to controls. Resting-state functional
magnetic resonance imaging was analyzed from the Autism Brain Imaging Data
Exchange (ABIDE) data set in 394 people with autism spectrum disorder and 473
controls, and effective connectivity (EC) was measured between 94 brain areas.
First, in autism, the middle temporal gyrus and other temporal areas had lower
effective connectivities to the precuneus and cuneus, and these were correlated
with the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule total, communication, and
social scores. This lower EC from areas implicated in face expression analysis
and theory of mind to the precuneus and cuneus implicated in the sense of self
may relate to the poor understanding of the implications of face expression
inputs for oneself in autism, and to the reduced theory of mind. Second, the
hippocampus and amygdala had higher EC to the middle temporal gyrus in autism,
and these are thought to be back projections based on anatomical evidence and are
weaker than in the other direction. This may be related to increased retrieval of
recent and emotional memories in autism. Third, some prefrontal cortex areas had 
higher EC with each other and with the precuneus and cuneus. Fourth, there was
decreased EC from the temporal pole to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and
there was evidence for lower activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a
brain area implicated in emotion-related decision-making. Autism Res 2020, 13:

LAY SUMMARY: To understand autism spectrum disorders better, it may be helpful to
understand whether brain systems cause effects on each other differently in
people with autism. In this first large-scale neuroimaging investigation of
effective connectivity in people with autism, it is shown that parts of the
temporal lobe involved in facial expression identification and theory of mind
have weaker effects on the precuneus and cuneus implicated in the sense of self. 
This may relate to the poor understanding of the implications of face expression 
inputs for oneself in autism, and to the reduced theory of mind.

Bipolar disorder (BD) has been linked to disrupted structural and functional
connectivity between prefrontal networks and limbic brain regions. Studies of
patients with pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) can help elucidate the
developmental origins of altered structural connectivity underlying BD and
provide novel insights into the aetiology of BD. Here we compare the network
properties of whole-brain structural connectomes of euthymic PBD patients with
psychosis, a variant of PBD, and matched healthy controls. Our results show
widespread changes in the structural connectivity of PBD patients with psychosis 
in both cortical and subcortical networks, notably affecting the orbitofrontal
cortex, frontal gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus and basal ganglia. Graph theoretical
analysis revealed that PBD connectomes have fewer hubs, weaker rich club
organization, different modular fingerprint and inter-modular communication,
compared to healthy participants. The relationship between network features and
neurocognitive and psychotic scores was also assessed, revealing trends of
association between patients' IQ and affective psychotic symptoms with the local 
efficiency of the orbitofrontal cortex. Our findings reveal that PBD with
psychosis is associated with significant widespread changes in structural network
topology, thus strengthening the hypothesis of a reduced capacity for integrative
processing of information across brain regions. Localised network changes involve
core regions for emotional processing and regulation, as well as memory and
executive function, some of which show trends of association with neurocognitive 
faculties and symptoms. Together, our findings provide the first comprehensive
characterisation of the alterations in local and global structural brain
connectivity and network topology, which may contribute to the deficits in
cognition and emotion processing and regulation found in PBD.

The brain operates at a critical point that is balanced between order and
disorder. Even during rest, unstable periods of random behavior are interspersed 
with stable periods of balanced activity patterns that support optimal
information processing. Being born preterm may cause deviations from this normal 
pattern of development. We compared 33 extremely preterm (EPT) children born at
< 27 weeks of gestation and 28 full-term controls. Two approaches were adopted in
both groups, when they were 10 years of age, using structural and functional
brain magnetic resonance imaging data. The first was using a novel intrinsic
ignition analysis to study the ability of the areas of the brain to propagate
neural activity. The second was a whole-brain Hopf model, to define the level of 
stability, desynchronization, or criticality of the brain. EPT-born children
exhibited fewer intrinsic ignition events than controls; nodes were related to
less sophisticated aspects of cognitive control, and there was a different
hierarchy pattern in the propagation of information and suboptimal synchronicity 
and criticality. The largest differences were found in brain nodes belonging to
the rich-club architecture. These results provide important insights into the
neural substrates underlying brain reorganization and neurodevelopmental
impairments related to prematurity.

A fundamental problem in systems neuroscience is how to force a transition from
one brain state to another by external driven stimulation in, for example,
wakefulness, sleep, coma, or neuropsychiatric diseases. This requires a
quantitative and robust definition of a brain state, which has so far proven
elusive. Here, we provide such a definition, which, together with whole-brain
modeling, permits the systematic study in silico of how simulated brain
stimulation can force transitions between different brain states in humans.
Specifically, we use a unique neuroimaging dataset of human sleep to
systematically investigate where to stimulate the brain to force an awakening of 
the human sleeping brain and vice versa. We show where this is possible using a
definition of a brain state as an ensemble of "metastable substates," each with a
probabilistic stability and occurrence frequency fitted by a generative
whole-brain model, fine-tuned on the basis of the effective connectivity. Given
the biophysical limitations of direct electrical stimulation (DES) of
microcircuits, this opens exciting possibilities for discovering stimulation
targets and selecting connectivity patterns that can ensure propagation of
DES-induced neural excitation, potentially making it possible to create
awakenings from complex cases of brain injury.

To go beyond the disconnectivity hypothesis of schizophrenia, directed
(effective) connectivity was measured between 94 brain regions, to provide
evidence on the source of the changes in schizophrenia and a mechanistic model.
Effective connectivity (EC) was measured in 180 participants with schizophrenia
and 208 controls. For the significantly different effective connectivities in
schizophrenia, on average the forward (stronger) effective connectivities were
smaller, whereas the backward connectivities tended to be larger. Further, higher
EC in schizophrenia was found from the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex
(PCC) to areas such as the parahippocampal, hippocampal, temporal, fusiform, and 
occipital cortices. These are backward effective connectivities and were
positively correlated with the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Lower
effective connectivities were found from temporal and other regions and were
negatively correlated with the symptoms, especially the negative and general
symptoms. Further, a signal variance parameter was increased for areas that
included the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, consistent with the
hypothesis that hippocampal overactivity is involved in schizophrenia. This
investigation goes beyond the disconnectivity hypothesis by drawing attention to 
differences in schizophrenia between backprojections and forward connections,
with the backward connections from the precuneus and PCC implicated in memory
stronger in schizophrenia.

Over the past 2,500 years, contemplative traditions have explored the nature of
the mind using meditation. More recently, neuroimaging research on meditation has
revealed differences in brain function and structure in meditators. Nevertheless,
the underlying neural mechanisms are still unclear. In order to understand how
meditation shapes global activity through the brain, we investigated the
spatiotemporal dynamics across the whole-brain functional network using the
Intrinsic Ignition Framework. Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that 
different states of consciousness differ in their underlying dynamical
complexity, i.e., how the broadness of communication is elicited and distributed 
through the brain over time and space. In this work, controls and experienced
meditators were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during
resting-state and meditation (focused attention on breathing). Our results
evidenced that the dynamical complexity underlying meditation shows less
complexity than during resting-state in the meditator group but not in the
control group. Furthermore, we report that during resting-state, the brain
activity of experienced meditators showed higher metastability (i.e., a wider
dynamical regime over time) than the one observed in the control group. Overall, 
these results indicate that the meditation state operates in a different
dynamical regime compared to the resting-state.

Neuroimaging techniques such as MRI have been widely used to explore the
associations between brain areas. Structural connectivity (SC) captures the
anatomical pathways across the brain and functional connectivity (FC) measures
the correlation between the activity of brain regions. These connectivity
measures have been much studied using network theory in order to uncover the
distributed organization of brain structures, in particular FC for task-specific 
brain communication. However, the application of network theory to study FC
matrices is often "static" despite the dynamic nature of time series obtained
from fMRI. The present study aims to overcome this limitation by introducing a
network-oriented analysis applied to whole-brain effective connectivity (EC)
useful to interpret the brain dynamics. Technically, we tune a multivariate
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (MOU) process to reproduce the statistics of the whole-brain
resting-state fMRI signals, which provides estimates for MOU-EC as well as input 
properties (similar to local excitabilities). The network analysis is then based 
on the Green function (or network impulse response) that describes the
interactions between nodes across time for the estimated dynamics. This
model-based approach provides time-dependent graph-like descriptor, named
communicability, that characterize the roles that either nodes or connections
play in the propagation of activity within the network. They can be used at both 
global and local levels, and also enables the comparison of estimates from real
data with surrogates (e.g. random network or ring lattice). In contrast to
classical graph approaches to study SC or FC, our framework stresses the
importance of taking the temporal aspect of fMRI signals into account. Our
results show a merging of functional communities over time, moving from
segregated to global integration of the network activity. Our formalism sets a
solid ground for the analysis and interpretation of fMRI data, including
task-evoked activity.

Recently introduced effective connectivity methods allow for the in-vivo
investigation of large-scale functional interactions between brain regions.
However, dynamic causal modeling, the most widely used technique to date,
typically captures only a few predefined regions of interest. In this study, we
present an alternative computational approach to infer effective connectivity
within the entire connectome and show its performance on a developmental cohort
with emerging language capacities. The novel approach provides new opportunities 
to quantify effective connectivity changes in the human brain.

Growing evidence from the dynamical analysis of functional neuroimaging data
suggests that brain function can be understood as the exploration of a repertoire
of metastable connectivity patterns ('functional brain networks'), which
potentially underlie different mental processes. The present study characterizes 
how the brain's dynamical exploration of resting-state networks is rapidly
modulated by intravenous infusion of psilocybin, a tryptamine psychedelic found
in "magic mushrooms". We employed a data-driven approach to characterize
recurrent functional connectivity patterns by focusing on the leading eigenvector
of BOLD phase coherence at single-TR resolution. Recurrent BOLD phase-locking
patterns (PL states) were assessed and statistically compared pre- and
post-infusion of psilocybin in terms of their probability of occurrence and
transition profiles. Results were validated using a placebo session. Recurrent
BOLD PL states revealed high spatial overlap with canonical resting-state
networks. Notably, a PL state forming a frontoparietal subsystem was strongly
destabilized after psilocybin injection, with a concomitant increase in the
probability of occurrence of another PL state characterized by global BOLD phase 
coherence. These findings provide evidence of network-specific neuromodulation by
psilocybin and represent one of the first attempts at bridging molecular
pharmacodynamics and whole-brain network dynamics.

By observing their social partners, primates learn about reward values of
objects. Here, we show that monkeys' amygdala neurons derive object values from
observation and use these values to simulate a partner monkey's decision process.
While monkeys alternated making reward-based choices, amygdala neurons encoded
object-specific values learned from observation. Dynamic activities converted
these values to representations of the recorded monkey's own choices.
Surprisingly, the same activity patterns unfolded spontaneously before partner's 
choices in separate neurons, as if these neurons simulated the partner's
decision-making. These "simulation neurons" encoded signatures of
mutual-inhibitory decision computation, including value comparisons and
value-to-choice conversions, resulting in accurate predictions of partner's
choices. Population decoding identified differential contributions of amygdala
subnuclei. Biophysical modeling of amygdala circuits showed that simulation
neurons emerge naturally from convergence between object-value neurons and
self-other neurons. By simulating decision computations during observation, these
neurons could allow primates to reconstruct their social partners' mental states.

The grouping of sensory stimuli into categories is fundamental to cognition.
Previous research in the visual and auditory systems supports a two-stage
processing hierarchy that underlies perceptual categorization: (a) a "bottom-up" 
perceptual stage in sensory cortices where neurons show selectivity for stimulus 
features and (b) a "top-down" second stage in higher level cortical areas that
categorizes the stimulus-selective input from the first stage. In order to test
the hypothesis that the two-stage model applies to the somatosensory system, 14
human participants were trained to categorize vibrotactile stimuli presented to
their right forearm. Then, during an fMRI scan, participants actively categorized
the stimuli. Representational similarity analysis revealed stimulus selectivity
in areas including the left precentral and postcentral gyri, the supramarginal
gyrus, and the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Crucially, we identified a single
category-selective region in the left ventral precentral gyrus. Furthermore, an
estimation of directed functional connectivity delivered evidence for robust
top-down connectivity from the second to first stage. These results support the
validity of the two-stage model of perceptual categorization for the
somatosensory system, suggesting common computational principles and a unified
theory of perceptual categorization across the visual, auditory, and
somatosensory systems.

The direction of functional information flow in the sensory thalamocortical
circuit may play a role in stimulus perception, but, surprisingly, this process
is poorly understood. We addressed this problem by evaluating a directional
information measure between simultaneously recorded neurons from somatosensory
thalamus (ventral posterolateral nucleus, VPL) and somatosensory cortex (S1)
sharing the same cutaneous receptive field while monkeys judged the presence or
absence of a tactile stimulus. During stimulus presence, feed-forward information
(VPL → S1) increased as a function of the stimulus amplitude, while pure
feed-back information (S1 → VPL) was unaffected. In parallel, zero-lag
interaction emerged with increasing stimulus amplitude, reflecting externally
driven thalamocortical synchronization during stimulus processing. Furthermore,
VPL → S1 information decreased during error trials. Also, VPL → S1 and zero-lag
interaction decreased when monkeys were not required to report the stimulus
presence. These findings provide evidence that both the direction of information 
flow and the instant synchronization in the sensory thalamocortical circuit play 
a role in stimulus perception.

Resting state fMRI is a tool for studying the functional organization of the
human brain. Ongoing brain activity at "rest" is highly dynamic, but procedures
such as correlation or independent component analysis treat functional
connectivity (FC) as if, theoretically, it is stationary and therefore the
fluctuations observed in FC are thought as noise. Consequently, FC is not usually
used as a single-subject level marker and it is limited to group studies. Here we
develop an imaging-based technique capable of reliably portraying information of 
local dynamics at a single-subject level by using a whole-brain model of ongoing 
dynamics that estimates a local parameter, which reflects if each brain region
presents stable, asynchronous or transitory oscillations. Using 50 longitudinal
resting-state sessions of one single subject and single resting-state sessions
from a group of 50 participants we demonstrate that brain dynamics can be
quantified consistently with respect to group dynamics using a scanning time of
20 min. We show that brain hubs are closer to a transition point between
synchronous and asynchronous oscillatory dynamics and that dynamics in frontal
areas have larger heterogeneity in its values compared to other lobules.
Nevertheless, frontal regions and hubs showed higher consistency within the same 
subject while the inter-session variability found in primary visual and motor
areas was only as high as the one found across subjects. The framework presented 
here can be used to study functional brain dynamics at group and, more
importantly, at individual level, opening new avenues for possible clinical
applications.

Neurobiological models to explain vulnerability of major depressive disorder
(MDD) are scarce and previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies
mostly examined "static" functional connectivity (FC). Knowing that FC constantly
evolves over time, it becomes important to assess how FC dynamically differs in
remitted-MDD patients vulnerable for new depressive episodes. Using a recently
developed method to examine dynamic FC, we characterized re-emerging FC states
during rest in 51 antidepressant-free MDD patients at high risk of recurrence (≥2
previous episodes), and 35 healthy controls. We examined differences in
occurrence, duration, and switching profiles of FC states after neutral and sad
mood induction. Remitted MDD patients showed a decreased probability of an FC
state (p < 0.005) consisting of an extensive network connecting frontal
areas-important for cognitive control-with default mode network, striatum, and
salience areas, involved in emotional and self-referential processing. Even when 
this FC state was observed in patients, it lasted shorter (p < 0.005) and was
less likely to switch to a smaller prefrontal-striatum network (p < 0.005).
Differences between patients and controls decreased after sad mood induction.
Further, the duration of this FC state increased in remitted patients after sad
mood induction but not in controls (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest reduced
ability of remitted-MDD patients, in neutral mood, to access a clinically
relevant control network involved in the interplay between externally and
internally oriented attention. When recovering from sad mood, remitted recurrent 
MDD appears to employ a compensatory mechanism to access this FC state. This
study provides a novel neurobiological profile of MDD vulnerability.

A key unresolved problem in neuroscience is to determine the relevant timescale
for understanding spatiotemporal dynamics across the whole brain. While resting
state fMRI reveals networks at an ultraslow timescale (below 0.1 Hz), other
neuroimaging modalities such as MEG and EEG suggest that much faster timescales
may be equally or more relevant for discovering spatiotemporal structure. Here,
we introduce a novel way to generate whole-brain neural dynamical activity at the
millisecond scale from fMRI signals. This method allows us to study the different
timescales through binning the output of the model. These timescales can then be 
investigated using a method (poetically named brain songs) to extract the
spacetime motifs at a given timescale. Using independent measures of entropy and 
hierarchy to characterize the richness of the dynamical repertoire, we show that 
both methods find a similar optimum at a timescale of around 200 ms in resting
state and in task data.

We considered a large-scale dynamical circuit model of human cerebral cortex with
region-specific microscale properties. The model was inverted using a stochastic 
optimization approach, yielding markedly better fit to new, out-of-sample resting
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Without assuming the existence
of a hierarchy, the estimated model parameters revealed a large-scale cortical
gradient. At one end, sensorimotor regions had strong recurrent connections and
excitatory subcortical inputs, consistent with localized processing of external
stimuli. At the opposing end, default network regions had weak recurrent
connections and excitatory subcortical inputs, consistent with their role in
internal thought. Furthermore, recurrent connection strength and subcortical
inputs provided complementary information for differentiating the levels of the
hierarchy, with only the former showing strong associations with other macroscale
and microscale proxies of cortical hierarchies (meta-analysis of cognitive
functions, principal resting fMRI gradient, myelin, and laminar-specific neuronal
density). Overall, this study provides microscale insights into a macroscale
cortical hierarchy in the dynamic resting brain.

The brain is organized as a network of highly specialized networks of spiking
neurons. To exploit such a modular architecture for computation, the brain has to
be able to regulate the flow of spiking activity between these specialized
networks. In this Opinion article, we review various prominent mechanisms that
may underlie communication between neuronal networks. We show that communication 
between neuronal networks can be understood as trajectories in a two-dimensional 
state space, spanned by the properties of the input. Thus, we propose a common
framework to understand neuronal communication mediated by seemingly different
mechanisms. We also suggest that the nesting of slow (for example, alpha-band and
theta-band) oscillations and fast (gamma-band) oscillations can serve as an
important control mechanism that allows or prevents spiking signals to be routed 
between specific networks. We argue that slow oscillations can modulate the time 
required to establish network resonance or entrainment and, thereby, regulate
communication between neuronal networks.

Our environment is full of statistical regularities, and we are attuned to learn 
about these regularities by employing Statistical Learning (SL), a domain-general
ability that enables the implicit detection of probabilistic regularities in our 
surrounding environment. The role of brain connectivity on SL has been previously
explored, highlighting the relevance of structural and functional connections
between frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices. However, whether SL can induce 
changes in the functional connections of the resting state brain has yet to be
investigated. To address this question, we applied a pre-post design where
participants (n = 38) were submitted to resting-state fMRI acquisition before and
after in-scanner exposure to either an artificial language stream (formed by 4
concatenated words) or a random audio stream. Our results showed that exposure to
an artificial language stream significantly changed (corrected p < 0.05) the
functional connectivity between Right Posterior Cingulum and Left Superior
Parietal Lobule. This suggests that functional connectivity between brain
networks supporting attentional and working memory processes may play an
important role in statistical learning.

The search for the universal laws of human brain function is still on-going but
progress is being made. Here we describe the novel concepts of connectome
harmonics and connectome-harmonic decomposition, which can be used to
characterize the brain activity associated with any mental state. We use this new
frequency-specific language to describe the brain activity elicited by psilocybin
and LSD and find remarkably similar effects in terms of increases in total energy
and power, as well as frequency-specific energy changes and repertoire expansion.
In addition, we find enhanced signatures of criticality suggesting that the brain
dynamics tune toward criticality in both psychedelic elicited states. Overall,
our findings provide new evidence for the remarkable ability of psychedelics to
change the spatiotemporal dynamics of the human brain.

Previous studies suggest that the brain operates at a critical point in which
phases of order and disorder coexist, producing emergent patterned dynamics at
all scales and optimizing several brain functions. Here, we combined light-sheet 
microscopy with GCaMP zebrafish larvae to study whole-brain dynamics in vivo at
near single-cell resolution. We show that spontaneous activity propagates in the 
brain's three-dimensional space, generating scale-invariant neuronal avalanches
with time courses and recurrence times that exhibit statistical self-similarity
at different magnitude, temporal, and frequency scales. This suggests that the
nervous system operates close to a non-equilibrium phase transition, where a
large repertoire of spatial, temporal, and interactive modes can be supported.
Finally, we show that gap junctions contribute to the maintenance of criticality 
and that, during interactions with the environment (sensory inputs and
self-generated behaviors), the system is transiently displaced to a more ordered 
regime, conceivably to limit the potential sensory representations and motor
outcomes.

Background and Purpose- Physiological effects of stroke are best assessed over
entire brain networks rather than just focally at the site of structural damage. 
Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging can map functional-anatomic
networks by analyzing spontaneously correlated low-frequency activity
fluctuations across the brain, but its potential usefulness in predicting
functional outcome after acute stroke remains unknown. We assessed the ability of
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to predict functional outcome
after acute stroke. Methods- We scanned 37 consecutive reperfused stroke patients
(age, 69±14 years; 14 females; 3-day National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
score, 6±5) on day 3 after symptom onset. After imaging preprocessing, we used a 
whole-brain mask to calculate the correlation coefficient matrices for every
paired region using the Harvard-Oxford probabilistic atlas. To evaluate
functional outcome, we applied the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. We used
region of interest analyses to explore the functional connectivity between
regions and graph-computation analysis to detect differences in functional
connectivity between patients with good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale
score ≤2) and those with poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score >2). Results- 
Patients with good outcome had greater functional connectivity than patients with
poor outcome. Although 3-day National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was
the most accurate independent predictor of 90-day modified Rankin Scale (84.2%), 
adding functional connectivity increased accuracy to 94.7%. Preserved bilateral
interhemispheric connectivity between the anterior inferior temporal gyrus and
superior frontal gyrus and decreased connectivity between the caudate and
anterior inferior temporal gyrus in the left hemisphere had the greatest impact
in favoring good prognosis. Conclusions- These data suggest that information
about functional connectivity from resting-state functional magnetic resonance
imaging may help predict 90-day stroke outcome.

Understanding the underlying mechanisms of the human brain in health and disease 
will require models with necessary and sufficient details to explain how function
emerges from the underlying anatomy and is shaped by neuromodulation. Here, we
provide such a detailed causal explanation using a whole-brain model integrating 
multimodal imaging in healthy human participants undergoing manipulation of the
serotonin system. Specifically, we combined anatomical data from diffusion
magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) with neurotransmitter data obtained with positron emission tomography
(PET) of the detailed serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) density map. This allowed
us to model the resting state (with and without concurrent music listening) and
mechanistically explain the functional effects of 5-HT2AR stimulation with
lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on healthy participants. The whole-brain model
used a dynamical mean-field quantitative description of populations of excitatory
and inhibitory neurons as well as the associated synaptic dynamics, where the
neuronal gain function of the model is modulated by the 5-HT2AR density. The
model identified the causative mechanisms for the non-linear interactions between
the neuronal and neurotransmitter system, which are uniquely linked to (1) the
underlying anatomical connectivity, (2) the modulation by the specific brainwide 
distribution of neurotransmitter receptor density, and (3) the non-linear
interactions between the two. Taking neuromodulatory activity into account when
modeling global brain dynamics will lead to novel insights into human brain
function in health and disease and opens exciting possibilities for drug
discovery and design in neuropsychiatric disorders.

Over the last decade there has been growing interest in understanding the brain
activity, in the absence of any task or stimulus, captured by the resting-state
functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). The resting state patterns have
been observed to be exhibiting complex spatio-temporal dynamics and substantial
effort has been made to characterize the dynamic functional connectivity (dFC)
configurations. However, the dynamics governing the state transitions that the
brain undergoes and their relationship to stationary functional connectivity
still remains an open problem. One class of approaches attempts to characterize
the dynamics in terms of finite number of latent brain states, however, such
attempts are yet to amalgamate the underlying anatomical structural connectivity 
(SC) with the dynamics. Another class of methods links individual dynamic FCs
with the underlying SC but does not characterize the temporal evolution of FC.
Further, the latent states discovered by previous approaches could not be
directly linked to the SC, thereby motivating us to discover the underlying
lower-dimensional manifold that represents the temporal structure. In the
proposed approach, the discovered manifold is further parameterized as a set of
local density distributions, or latent transient states. We propose an innovative
method that learns parameters specific to the latent states using a
graph-theoretic model (temporal Multiple Kernel Learning, tMKL) that inherently
links dynamics to the structure and finally predicts the grand average FC of the 
test subjects by leveraging a state transition Markov model. The proposed
solution does not make strong assumptions about the underlying data and is
generally applicable to resting or task data for learning subject-specific state 
transitions and for successfully characterizing SC-dFC-FC relationship through a 
unifying framework. Training and testing were done using the rs-fMRI data of 46
healthy participants. tMKL model performs significantly better than the existing 
models for predicting resting state functional connectivity based on whole-brain 
dynamic mean-field model (DMF), single diffusion kernel (SDK) model and multiple 
kernel learning (MKL) model. Further, the learned model was tested on an
independent cohort of 100 young, healthy participants from the Human Connectome
Project (HCP) and the results establish the generalizability of the proposed
solution. More importantly, the model retains sensitivity toward subject-specific
anatomy, a unique contribution towards a holistic approach for SC-FC
characterization.

A fundamental question in systems neuroscience is how endogenous neuronal
activity self-organizes during particular brain states. Recent neuroimaging
studies have demonstrated systematic relationships between resting-state and
task-induced functional connectivity (FC). In particular, continuous task
studies, such as movie watching, speak to alterations in coupling among cortical 
regions and enhanced fluctuations in FC compared to the resting-state. This
suggests that FC may reflect systematic and large-scale reorganization of
functionally integrated responses while subjects are watching movies. In this
study, we characterized fluctuations in FC during resting-state and
movie-watching conditions. We found that the FC patterns induced systematically
by movie-watching can be explained with a single principal component. These
condition-specific FC fluctuations overlapped with inter-subject synchronization 
patterns in occipital and temporal brain regions. However, unlike inter-subject
synchronization, condition-specific FC patterns were characterized by increased
correlations within frontal brain regions and reduced correlations between
frontal-parietal brain regions. We investigated these condition-specific
functional variations as a shorter time scale, using time-resolved FC. The
time-resolved FC showed condition-specificity over time; notably when subjects
watched both the same and different movies. To explain self-organisation of
global FC through the alterations in local dynamics, we used a large-scale
computational model. We found that condition-specific reorganization of FC could 
be explained by local changes that engendered changes in FC among higher-order
association regions, mainly in frontal and parietal cortices.

The study of brain communication based on fMRI data is often limited because such
measurements are a mixture of session-to-session variability with subject- and
condition-related information. Disentangling these contributions is crucial for
real-life applications, in particular when only a few recording sessions are
available. The present study aims to define a reliable standard for the
extraction of multiple signatures from fMRI data, while verifying that they do
not mix information about the different modalities (e.g., subjects and conditions
such as tasks performed by them). In particular, condition-specific signatures
should not be contaminated by subject-related information, since they aim to
generalize over subjects. Practically, signatures correspond to subnetworks of
directed interactions between brain regions (typically 100 covering the whole
brain) supporting the subject and condition identification for single fMRI
sessions. The key for robust prediction is using effective connectivity instead
of functional connectivity. Our method demonstrates excellent generalization
capabilities for subject identification in two datasets, using only a few
sessions per subject as reference. Using another dataset with resting state and
movie viewing, we show that the two signatures related to subjects and tasks
correspond to distinct subnetworks, which are thus topologically orthogonal. Our 
results set solid foundations for applications tailored to individual subjects,
such as clinical diagnostic.

Among the major psychiatric disorders, anxious-depressive disorders stand out as 
one of the more prevalent and more frequently associated with
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis abnormalities. Methylation at the exon 
1F of the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1 has been associated with both early 
stress exposure and risk for developing a psychiatric disorder; however, other
NR3C1 promoter regions have been underexplored. Exon 1D emerges as a suggestive
new target in stress-related disorders epigenetically sensitive to early
adversity. After assessment of 48 monozygotic twin pairs (n=96 subjects)
informative for lifetime history of anxious-depressive disorders, they were
classified as concordant, discordant or healthy in function of whether both, one 
or neither twin in each pair had a lifetime diagnosis of anxious-depressive
disorders. DNA for epigenetic analysis was extracted from peripheral blood. Exon 
1F and exon 1D CpG-specific methylation was analysed by means of pyrosequencing
technology. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was available for 54 subjects
(n=27 twin pairs). Exon 1D CpG-specific methylation within a glucocorticoid
responsive element (GRE) was correlated with familial burden of
anxious-depressive disorders (r=0.35, z=2.26, p=0.02). Right hippocampal
connectivity was significantly associated with CpG-specific GRE methylation
(β=-2.33, t=-2.85, p=0.01). Exon 1F was uniformly hypomethylated across all
subgroups of the present sample. GRE hypermethylation at exon 1D of the NR3C1
gene in monozygotic twins concordant for anxious-depressive disorders suggests
this region plays a role in increasing vulnerability to psychosocial stress,
partly mediated by altered hippocampal connectivity.

Modeling and interpreting (partial) synchronous neural activity can be a
challenge. We illustrate this by deriving the phase dynamics of two seminal
neural mass models: the Wilson-Cowan firing rate model and the voltage-based
Freeman model. We established that the phase dynamics of these models differed
qualitatively due to an attractive coupling in the first and a repulsive coupling
in the latter. Using empirical structural connectivity matrices, we determined
that the two dynamics cover the functional connectivity observed in resting state
activity. We further searched for two pivotal dynamical features that have been
reported in many experimental studies: (1) a partial phase synchrony with a
possibility of a transition towards either a desynchronized or a (fully)
synchronized state; (2) long-term autocorrelations indicative of a scale-free
temporal dynamics of phase synchronization. Only the Freeman phase model
exhibited scale-free behavior. Its repulsive coupling, however, let the
individual phases disperse and did not allow for a transition into a synchronized
state. The Wilson-Cowan phase model, by contrast, could switch into a (partially)
synchronized state, but it did not generate long-term correlations although being
located close to the onset of synchronization, i.e. in its critical regime. That 
is, the phase-reduced models can display one of the two dynamical features, but
not both.

Epileptic seizures are known to follow specific changes in brain dynamics. While 
some algorithms can nowadays robustly detect these changes, a clear understanding
of the mechanism by which these alterations occur and generate seizures is still 
lacking. Here, we provide crossvalidated evidence that such changes are initiated
by an alteration of physiological network state dynamics. Specifically, our
analysis of long intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from a
group of 10 patients identifies a critical phase of a few hours in which
time-dependent network states become less variable ("degenerate"), and this phase
is followed by a global functional connectivity reduction before seizure onset.
This critical phase is characterized by an abnormal occurrence of highly
correlated network instances and is shown to be particularly associated with the 
activity of the resected regions in patients with validated postsurgical outcome.
Our approach characterizes preseizure network dynamics as a cascade of 2
sequential events providing new insights into seizure prediction and control.

BACKGROUND: Resting-state functional connectivity reflects correlations in the
activity between brain areas, whereas effective connectivity between different
brain areas measures directed influences of brain regions on each other. Using
the latter approach, we compare effective connectivity results in patients with
major depressive disorder (MDD) and control subjects.
METHODS: We used a new approach to the measurement of effective connectivity, in 
which each brain area has a simple dynamical model, and known anatomical
connectivity is used to provide constraints. This helps the approach to measure
the effective connectivity between the 94 brain areas parceled in the automated
anatomical labeling (AAL2) atlas, using resting-state functional magnetic
resonance imaging. Moreover, we show how the approach can be used to measure the 
differences in effective connectivity between different groups of individuals,
using as an example effective connectivity in the healthy brain and in
individuals with depression. The first brainwide resting-state
effective-connectivity neuroimaging analysis of depression, with 350 healthy
individuals and 336 patients with major depressive disorder, is described.
RESULTS: Key findings are that the medial orbitofrontal cortex, implicated in
reward and subjective pleasure, has reduced effective connectivity from temporal 
lobe input areas in depression; that the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, implicated
in nonreward, has increased activity (variance) in depression, with decreased
effective connectivity to and from cortical areas contralateral to
language-related areas; and that the hippocampus, implicated in memory, has
increased activity (variance) in depression and increased effective connectivity 
from the temporal pole.
CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of effective connectivity made using the new method
provide a new approach to causal mechanisms in the brain in depression.

Converging research suggests that the resting brain operates at the cusp of
dynamic instability, as signified by scale-free temporal correlations. We asked
whether the scaling properties of these correlations differ between amplitude and
phase fluctuations, which may reflect different aspects of cortical functioning. 
Using source-reconstructed magneto-encephalographic signals, we found power-law
scaling for the collective amplitude and for phase synchronization, both
capturing whole-brain activity. The temporal changes of the amplitude comprise
slow, persistent memory processes, whereas phase synchronization exhibits less
temporally structured and more complex correlations, indicating a fast and
flexible coding. This distinct temporal scaling supports the idea of different
roles of amplitude and phase fluctuations in cortical functioning.

Cognitive processing requires the ability to flexibly integrate and process
information across large brain networks. How do brain networks dynamically
reorganize to allow broad communication between many different brain regions in
order to integrate information? We record neural activity from 12 epileptic
patients using intracranial EEG while performing three cognitive tasks. We assess
how the functional connectivity between different brain areas changes to
facilitate communication across them. At the topological level, this facilitation
is characterized by measures of integration and segregation. Across all patients,
we found significant increases in integration and decreases in segregation during
cognitive processing, especially in the gamma band (50-90 Hz). We also found
higher levels of global synchronization and functional connectivity during task
execution, again particularly in the gamma band. More importantly, functional
connectivity modulations were not caused by changes in the level of the
underlying oscillations. Instead, these modulations were caused by a
rearrangement of the mutual synchronization between the different nodes as
proposed by the "Communication Through Coherence" Theory.

The neurophysiological processes underlying non-invasive brain activity
measurements are incompletely understood. Here, we developed a connectome-based
brain network model that integrates individual structural and functional data
with neural population dynamics to support multi-scale neurophysiological
inference. Simulated populations were linked by structural connectivity and, as a
novelty, driven by electroencephalography (EEG) source activity. Simulations not 
only predicted subjects' individual resting-state functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) time series and spatial network topologies over 20 minutes of
activity, but more importantly, they also revealed precise neurophysiological
mechanisms that underlie and link six empirical observations from different
scales and modalities: (1) resting-state fMRI oscillations, (2) functional
connectivity networks, (3) excitation-inhibition balance, (4, 5) inverse
relationships between α-rhythms, spike-firing and fMRI on short and long time
scales, and (6) fMRI power-law scaling. These findings underscore the potential
of this new modelling framework for general inference and integration of
neurophysiological knowledge to complement empirical studies.

Spontaneous activity measured in human subject under the absence of any task
exhibits complex patterns of correlation that largely correspond to large-scale
functional topographies obtained with a wide variety of cognitive and perceptual 
tasks. These "resting state networks" (RSNs) fluctuate over time, forming and
dissolving on the scale of seconds to minutes. While these fluctuations, most
prominently those of the default mode network, have been linked to cognitive
function, it remains unclear whether they result from random noise or whether
they index a nonstationary process which could be described as state switching.
In this study, we use a sliding windows-approach to relate temporal dynamics of
RSNs to global modulations in correlation and BOLD variance. We compare empirical
data, phase-randomized surrogate data, and data simulated with a stationary
model. We find that RSN time courses exhibit a large amount of coactivation in
all three cases, and that the modulations in their activity are closely linked to
global dynamics of the underlying BOLD signal. We find that many properties of
the observed fluctuations in FC and BOLD, including their ranges and their
correlations amongst each other, are explained by fluctuations around the average
FC structure. However, we also report some interesting characteristics that
clearly support nonstationary features in the data. In particular, we find that
the brain spends more time in the troughs of modulations than can be expected
from stationary dynamics.

Planar intra-cortical electrode (Utah) arrays provide a unique window into the
spatial organization of cortical activity. Reconstruction of the current source
density (CSD) underlying such recordings, however, requires "inverting" Poisson's
equation. For inter-laminar recordings, this is commonly done by the CSD method, 
which consists in taking the second-order spatial derivative of the recorded
local field potentials (LFPs). Although the CSD method has been tremendously
successful in mapping the current generators underlying inter-laminar LFPs, its
application to planar recordings is more challenging. While for inter-laminar
recordings the CSD method seems reasonably robust against violations of its
assumptions, is it unclear as to what extent this holds for planar recordings.
One of the objectives of this study is to characterize the conditions under which
the CSD method can be successfully applied to Utah array data. Using forward
modeling, we find that for spatially coherent CSDs, the CSD method yields
inaccurate reconstructions due to volume-conducted contamination from currents in
deeper cortical layers. An alternative approach is to "invert" a constructed
forward model. The advantage of this approach is that any a priori knowledge
about the geometrical and electrical properties of the tissue can be taken into
account. Although several inverse methods have been proposed for LFP data, the
applicability of existing electroencephalographic (EEG) and
magnetoencephalographic (MEG) inverse methods to LFP data is largely unexplored. 
Another objective of our study therefore, is to assess the applicability of the
most commonly used EEG/MEG inverse methods to Utah array data. Our main
conclusion is that these inverse methods provide more accurate CSD
reconstructions than the CSD method. We illustrate the inverse methods using
event-related potentials recorded from primary visual cortex of a macaque monkey 
during a motion discrimination task.

Recent studies have started to elucidate the effects of lysergic acid
diethylamide (LSD) on the human brain but the underlying dynamics are not yet
fully understood. Here we used 'connectome-harmonic decomposition', a novel
method to investigate the dynamical changes in brain states. We found that LSD
alters the energy and the power of individual harmonic brain states in a
frequency-selective manner. Remarkably, this leads to an expansion of the
repertoire of active brain states, suggestive of a general re-organization of
brain dynamics given the non-random increase in co-activation across frequencies.
Interestingly, the frequency distribution of the active repertoire of brain
states under LSD closely follows power-laws indicating a re-organization of the
dynamics at the edge of criticality. Beyond the present findings, these methods
open up for a better understanding of the complex brain dynamics in health and
disease.

Human neuroimaging research has revealed that wakefulness and sleep involve very 
different activity patterns. Yet, it is not clear why brain states differ in
their dynamical complexity, e.g. in the level of integration and segregation
across brain networks over time. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying
the dynamical stability of brain states using a novel off-line in silico
perturbation protocol. We first adjust a whole-brain computational model to the
basal dynamics of wakefulness and deep sleep recorded with fMRI in two
independent human fMRI datasets. Then, the models of sleep and awake brain states
are perturbed using two distinct multifocal protocols either promoting or
disrupting synchronization in randomly selected brain areas. Once perturbation is
halted, we use a novel measure, the Perturbative Integration Latency Index
(PILI), to evaluate the recovery back to baseline. We find a clear distinction
between models, consistently showing larger PILI in wakefulness than in deep
sleep, corroborating previous experimental findings. In the models, larger
recoveries are associated to a critical slowing down induced by a shift in the
model's operation point, indicating that the awake brain operates further from a 
stable equilibrium than deep sleep. This novel approach opens up for a new level 
of artificial perturbative studies unconstrained by ethical limitations allowing 
for a deeper investigation of the dynamical properties of different brain states.

Higher cognition may require the globally coordinated integration of specialized 
brain regions into functional networks. A collection of structural cortical
hubs-referred to as the rich club-has been hypothesized to support task-specific 
functional integration. In the present paper, we use a whole-cortex model to
estimate directed interactions between 68 cortical regions from functional
magnetic resonance imaging activity for four different tasks (reflecting
different cognitive domains) and resting state. We analyze the state-dependent
input and output effective connectivity (EC) of the structural rich club and
relate these to whole-cortex dynamics and network reconfigurations. We find that 
the cortical rich club exhibits an increase in outgoing EC during task
performance as compared with rest while incoming connectivity remains constant.
Increased outgoing connectivity targets a sparse set of peripheral regions with
specific regions strongly overlapping between tasks. At the same time, community 
detection analyses reveal massive reorganizations of interactions among
peripheral regions, including those serving as target of increased rich club
output. This suggests that while peripheral regions may play a role in several
tasks, their concrete interplay might nonetheless be task-specific. Furthermore, 
we observe that whole-cortex dynamics are faster during task as compared with
rest. The decoupling effects usually accompanying faster dynamics appear to be
counteracted by the increased rich club outgoing EC. Together our findings speak 
to a gating mechanism of the rich club that supports fast-paced information
exchange among relevant peripheral regions in a task-specific and goal-directed
fashion, while constantly listening to the whole network.

Our behavior entails a flexible and context-sensitive interplay between brain
areas to integrate information according to goal-directed requirements. However, 
the neural mechanisms governing the entrainment of functionally specialized brain
areas remain poorly understood. In particular, the question arises whether
observed changes in the regional activity for different cognitive conditions are 
explained by modifications of the inputs to the brain or its connectivity? We
observe that transitions of fMRI activity between areas convey information about 
the tasks performed by 19 subjects, watching a movie versus a black screen
(rest). We use a model-based framework that explains this spatiotemporal
functional connectivity pattern by the local variability for 66 cortical regions 
and the network effective connectivity between them. We find that, among the
estimated model parameters, movie viewing affects to a larger extent the local
activity, which we interpret as extrinsic changes related to the increased
stimulus load. However, detailed changes in the effective connectivity preserve a
balance in the propagating activity and select specific pathways such that
high-level brain regions integrate visual and auditory information, in particular
boosting the communication between the two brain hemispheres. These findings
speak to a dynamic coordination underlying the functional integration in the
brain.

The brain is a network that mediates information processing through a wide range 
of states. The extent of state diversity is a reflection of the entropy of the
network. Here we measured the entropy of brain regions (nodes) in empirical and
modeled functional networks reconstructed from resting state fMRI to address the 
connection of entropy at rest with the underlying structure measured through
diffusion spectrum imaging. Using 18 empirical and 18 modeled stroke networks, we
also investigated the effect that focal lesions have on node entropy and
information diffusion. Overall, positive correlations between node entropy and
structure were observed, especially between node entropy and node strength in
both empirical and modeled data. Although lesions were restricted to one
hemisphere in all stroke patients, entropy reduction was not only present in
nodes from the damaged hemisphere, but also in nodes from the contralesioned
hemisphere, an effect replicated in modeled stroke networks. Globally,
information diffusion was also affected in empirical and modeled strokes compared
with healthy controls. This is the first study showing that artificial lesions
affect local and global network aspects in very similar ways compared with
empirical strokes, shedding new light into the functional nature of stroke.

A precise definition of a brain state has proven elusive. Here, we introduce the 
novel local-global concept of intrinsic ignition characterizing the dynamical
complexity of different brain states. Naturally occurring intrinsic ignition
events reflect the capability of a given brain area to propagate neuronal
activity to other regions, giving rise to different levels of integration. The
ignitory capability of brain regions is computed by the elicited level of
integration for each intrinsic ignition event in each brain region, averaged over
all events. This intrinsic ignition method is shown to clearly distinguish human 
neuroimaging data of two fundamental brain states (wakefulness and deep sleep).
Importantly, whole-brain computational modelling of this data shows that at the
optimal working point is found where there is maximal variability of the
intrinsic ignition across brain regions. Thus, combining whole brain models with 
intrinsic ignition can provide novel insights into underlying mechanisms of brain
states.

A popular way to analyze resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and magneto
encephalography (MEG) data is to treat them as a functional network in which
sensors are identified with nodes and the interaction between channel time series
and the network connections. Although conceptually appealing, the
network-theoretical approach to sensor-level EEG and MEG data is challenged by
the fact that EEG and MEG time series are mixtures of source activity. It is,
therefore, of interest to assess the relationship between functional networks of 
source activity and the ensuing sensor-level networks. Since these topological
features are of high interest in experimental studies, we address the question of
to what extent the network topology can be reconstructed from sensor-level
functional connectivity (FC) measures in case of MEG data. Simple simulations
that consider only a small number of regions do not allow to assess network
properties; therefore, we use a diffusion magnetic resonance imaging-constrained 
whole-brain computational model of resting-state activity. Our motivation lies
behind the fact that still many contributions found in the literature perform
network analysis at sensor level, and we aim at showing the discrepancies between
source- and sensor-level network topologies by using realistic simulations of
resting-state cortical activity. Our main findings are that the effect of field
spread on network topology depends on the type of interaction (instantaneous or
lagged) and leads to an underestimation of lagged FC at sensor level due to
instantaneous mixing of cortical signals, instantaneous interaction is more
sensitive to field spread than lagged interaction, and discrepancies are reduced 
when using planar gradiometers rather than axial gradiometers. We, therefore,
recommend using lagged interaction measures on planar gradiometer data when
investigating network properties of resting-state sensor-level MEG data.

Time-resolved analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
(rs-fMRI) data allows researchers to extract more information about brain
function than traditional functional connectivity analysis, yet a number of
challenges in data analysis and interpretation remain. This article briefly
summarizes common methods for time-resolved analysis and presents some of the
pressing issues and opportunities in the field. From there, the discussion moves 
to interpretation of the network dynamics observed with rs-fMRI and the role that
rs-fMRI can play in elucidating the large-scale organization of brain activity.

A fundamental characteristic of spontaneous brain activity is coherent
oscillations covering a wide range of frequencies. Interestingly, these temporal 
oscillations are highly correlated among spatially distributed cortical areas
forming structured correlation patterns known as the resting state networks,
although the brain is never truly at "rest." Here, we introduce the concept of
harmonic brain modes-fundamental building blocks of complex spatiotemporal
patterns of neural activity. We define these elementary harmonic brain modes as
harmonic modes of structural connectivity; that is, connectome harmonics,
yielding fully synchronous neural activity patterns with different frequency
oscillations emerging on and constrained by the particular structure of the
brain. Hence, this particular definition implicitly links the hitherto poorly
understood dimensions of space and time in brain dynamics and its underlying
anatomy. Further we show how harmonic brain modes can explain the relationship
between neurophysiological, temporal, and network-level changes in the brain
across different mental states ( wakefulness, sleep, anesthesia, psychedelic).
Notably, when decoded as activation of connectome harmonics, spatial and temporal
characteristics of neural activity naturally emerge from the interplay between
excitation and inhibition and this critical relation fits the spatial, temporal, 
and neurophysiological changes associated with different mental states. Thus, the
introduced framework of harmonic brain modes not only establishes a relation
between the spatial structure of correlation patterns and temporal oscillations
(linking space and time in brain dynamics), but also enables a new dimension of
tools for understanding fundamental principles underlying brain dynamics in
different states of consciousness.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia with dramatic consequences. 
The research in structural and functional neuroimaging showed altered brain
connectivity in AD. In this study, we investigated the whole-brain resting state 
functional connectivity (FC) of the subjects with preclinical Alzheimer's disease
(PAD), mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI) and mild dementia due to
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the impact of APOE4 carriership, as well as in relation
to variations in core AD CSF biomarkers. The synchronization in the whole-brain
was monotonously decreasing during the course of the disease progression.
Furthermore, in AD patients we found widespread significant decreases in
functional connectivity (FC) strengths particularly in the brain regions with
high global connectivity. We employed a whole-brain computational modeling
approach to study the mechanisms underlying these alterations. To characterize
the causal interactions between brain regions, we estimated the effective
connectivity (EC) in the model. We found that the significant EC differences in
AD were primarily located in left temporal lobe. Then, we systematically
manipulated the underlying dynamics of the model to investigate simulated changes
in FC based on the healthy control subjects. Furthermore, we found distinct
patterns involving CSF biomarkers of amyloid-beta (Aβ1 - 42) total tau (t-tau)
and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). CSF Aβ1 - 42 was associated to the contrast
between healthy control subjects and clinical groups. Nevertheless, tau CSF
biomarkers were associated to the variability in whole-brain synchronization and 
sensory integration regions. These associations were robust across clinical
groups, unlike the associations that were found for CSF Aβ1 - 42. APOE4
carriership showed no significant correlations with the connectivity measures.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease is a highly effective
treatment in controlling otherwise debilitating symptoms. Yet the underlying
brain mechanisms are currently not well understood. Whole-brain computational
modeling was used to disclose the effects of DBS during resting-state functional 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging in ten patients with Parkinson's disease.
Specifically, we explored the local and global impact that DBS has in creating
asynchronous, stable or critical oscillatory conditions using a supercritical
bifurcation model. We found that DBS shifts global brain dynamics of patients
towards a Healthy regime. This effect was more pronounced in very specific brain 
areas such as the thalamus, globus pallidus and orbitofrontal regions of the
right hemisphere (with the left hemisphere not analyzed given artifacts arising
from the electrode lead). Global aspects of integration and synchronization were 
also rebalanced. Empirically, we found higher communicability and coherence brain
measures during DBS-ON compared to DBS-OFF. Finally, using our model as a
framework, artificial in silico DBS was applied to find potential alternative
target areas for stimulation and whole-brain rebalancing. These results offer
important insights into the underlying large-scale effects of DBS as well as in
finding novel stimulation targets, which may offer a route to more efficacious
treatments.

It is well-established that patterns of functional connectivity (FC) - measures
of correlated activity between pairs of voxels or regions observed in the human
brain using neuroimaging - are robustly expressed in spontaneous activity during 
rest. These patterns are not static, but exhibit complex spatio-temporal
dynamics. Over the last years, a multitude of methods have been proposed to
reveal these dynamics on the level of the whole brain. One finding is that the
brain transitions through different FC configurations over time, and substantial 
effort has been put into characterizing these configurations. However, the
dynamics governing these transitions are more elusive, specifically, the
contribution of stationary vs. non-stationary dynamics is an active field of
inquiry. In this study, we use a whole-brain approach, considering FC dynamics
between 66 ROIs covering the entire cortex. We combine an innovative
dimensionality reduction technique, tensor decomposition, with a mean field model
which possesses stationary dynamics. It has been shown to explain resting state
FC averaged over time and multiple subjects, however, this average FC summarizes 
the spatial distribution of correlations while hiding their temporal dynamics.
First, we apply tensor decomposition to resting state scans from 24 healthy
controls in order to characterize spatio-temporal dynamics present in the data.
We simultaneously utilize temporal and spatial information by creating tensors
that are subsequently decomposed into sets of brain regions ("communities") that 
share similar temporal dynamics, and their associated time courses. The tensors
contain pairwise FC computed inside of overlapping sliding windows. Communities
are discovered by clustering features pooled from all subjects, thereby ensuring 
that they generalize. We find that, on the group level, the data give rise to
four distinct communities that resemble known resting state networks (RSNs):
default mode network, visual network, control networks, and somatomotor network. 
Second, we simulate data with our stationary mean field model whose nodes are
connected according to results from DTI and fiber tracking. In this model, all
spatio-temporal structure is due to noisy fluctuations around the average FC. We 
analyze the simulated data in the same way as the empirical data in order to
determine whether stationary dynamics can explain the emergence of distinct FC
patterns (RSNs) which have their own time courses. We find that this is the case 
for all four networks using the spatio-temporal information revealed by tensor
decomposition if nodes in the simulation are connected according to model-based
effective connectivity. Furthermore, we find that these results require only a
small part of the FC values, namely the highest values that occur across time and
ROI pair. Our findings show that stationary dynamics can account for the
emergence of RSNs. We provide an innovative method that does not make strong
assumptions about the underlying data and is generally applicable to resting
state or task data from different subject populations.

Growing evidence has shown that brain activity at rest slowly wanders through a
repertoire of different states, where whole-brain functional connectivity (FC)
temporarily settles into distinct FC patterns. Nevertheless, the functional role 
of resting-state activity remains unclear. Here, we investigate how the switching
behavior of resting-state FC relates with cognitive performance in healthy older 
adults. We analyse resting-state fMRI data from 98 healthy adults previously
categorized as being among the best or among the worst performers in a cohort
study of >1000 subjects aged 50+ who underwent neuropsychological assessment. We 
use a novel approach focusing on the dominant FC pattern captured by the leading 
eigenvector of dynamic FC matrices. Recurrent FC patterns - or states - are
detected and characterized in terms of lifetime, probability of occurrence and
switching profiles. We find that poorer cognitive performance is associated with 
weaker FC temporal similarity together with altered switching between FC states. 
These results provide new evidence linking the switching dynamics of FC during
rest with cognitive performance in later life, reinforcing the functional role of
resting-state activity for effective cognitive processing.

Increasing evidence suggests that sensory stimulation not only changes the level 
of cortical activity with respect to baseline but also its structure. Despite
having been reported in a multitude of conditions and preparations (for instance,
as a quenching of intertrial variability, Churchland et al., 2010), such changes 
remain relatively poorly characterized. Here, we used optical imaging of
voltage-sensitive dyes to explore, in V4 of an awake macaque, the spatiotemporal 
characteristics of both visually evoked and spontaneously ongoing neuronal
activity and their difference. With respect to the spontaneous case, we detected 
a reduction in large-scale activity ([Formula: see text]) in the alpha range (5
to 12.5 Hz) during sensory inflow accompanied by a decrease in pairwise
correlations. Moreover, the spatial patterns of correlation obtained during the
different visual stimuli were on the average more similar one to another than
they were to that obtained in the absence of stimulation. Finally, these observed
changes in activity dynamics approached saturation already at very low stimulus
contrasts, unlike the progressive, near-linear increase of the mean raw evoked
responses over a wide range of contrast values, which could indicate a specific
switching in the presence of a sensory inflow.

Recent research has found that the human sleep cycle is characterised by changes 
in spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity. Yet, we are still missing a
mechanistic explanation of the local neuronal dynamics underlying these changes. 
We used whole-brain computational modelling to study the differences in global
brain functional connectivity and synchrony of fMRI activity in healthy humans
during wakefulness and slow-wave sleep. We applied a whole-brain model based on
the normal form of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation and studied the dynamical
changes when adapting the bifurcation parameter for all brain nodes to best match
wakefulness and slow-wave sleep. Furthermore, we analysed differences in
effective connectivity between the two states. In addition to significant changes
in functional connectivity, synchrony and metastability, this analysis revealed a
significant shift of the global dynamic working point of brain dynamics, from the
edge of the transition between damped to sustained oscillations during
wakefulness, to a stable focus during slow-wave sleep. Moreover, we identified a 
significant global decrease in effective interactions during slow-wave sleep.
These results suggest a mechanism for the empirical functional changes observed
during slow-wave sleep, namely a global shift of the brain's dynamic working
point leading to increased stability and decreased effective connectivity.

The functional architecture of spontaneous BOLD fluctuations has been
characterized in detail by numerous studies, demonstrating its potential
relevance as a biomarker. However, the systematic investigation of its
consistency is still in its infancy. Here, we analyze within- and between-subject
variability and test-retest reliability of resting-state functional connectivity 
(FC) in a unique data set comprising multiple fMRI scans (42) from 5 subjects,
and 50 single scans from 50 subjects. We adopt a statistical framework that
enables us to identify different sources of variability in FC. We show that the
low reliability of single links can be significantly improved by using multiple
scans per subject. Moreover, in contrast to earlier studies, we show that spatial
heterogeneity in FC reliability is not significant. Finally, we demonstrate that 
despite the low reliability of individual links, the information carried by the
whole-brain FC matrix is robust and can be used as a functional fingerprint to
identify individual subjects from the population.

In the human brain, spontaneous activity during resting state consists of rapid
transitions between functional network states over time but the underlying
mechanisms are not understood. We use connectome based computational brain
network modeling to reveal fundamental principles of how the human brain
generates large-scale activity observable by noninvasive neuroimaging. We used
structural and functional neuroimaging data to construct whole- brain models.
With this novel approach, we reveal that the human brain during resting state
operates at maximum metastability, i.e. in a state of maximum network switching. 
In addition, we investigate cortical heterogeneity across areas. Optimization of 
the spectral characteristics of each local brain region revealed the dynamical
cortical core of the human brain, which is driving the activity of the rest of
the whole brain. Brain network modelling goes beyond correlational neuroimaging
analysis and reveals non-trivial network mechanisms underlying non-invasive
observations. Our novel findings significantly pertain to the important role of
computational connectomics in understanding principles of brain function.

A general theory of brain function has to be able to explain local and non-local 
network computations over space and time. We propose a new framework to capture
the key principles of how local activity influences global computation, i.e.,
describing the propagation of information and thus the broadness of communication
driven by local activity. More specifically, we consider the diversity in space
(nodes or brain regions) over time using the concept of intrinsic ignition, which
are naturally occurring intrinsic perturbations reflecting the capability of a
given brain area to propagate neuronal activity to other regions in a given brain
state. Characterizing the profile of intrinsic ignition for a given brain state
provides insight into the precise nature of hierarchical information processing. 
Combining this data-driven method with a causal whole-brain computational model
can provide novel insights into the imbalance of brain states found in
neuropsychiatric disorders.

Brain activity displays a large repertoire of dynamics across the sleep-wake
cycle and even during anesthesia. It was suggested that criticality could serve
as a unifying principle underlying the diversity of dynamics. This view has been 
supported by the observation of spontaneous bursts of cortical activity with
scale-invariant sizes and durations, known as neuronal avalanches, in recordings 
of mesoscopic cortical signals. However, the existence of neuronal avalanches in 
spiking activity has been equivocal with studies reporting both its presence and 
absence. Here, we show that signs of criticality in spiking activity can change
between synchronized and desynchronized cortical states. We analyzed the
spontaneous activity in the primary visual cortex of the anesthetized cat and the
awake monkey, and found that neuronal avalanches and thermodynamic indicators of 
criticality strongly depend on collective synchrony among neurons, LFP
fluctuations, and behavioral state. We found that synchronized states are
associated to criticality, large dynamical repertoire and prolonged epochs of eye
closure, while desynchronized states are associated to sub-criticality, reduced
dynamical repertoire, and eyes open conditions. Our results show that criticality
in cortical dynamics is not stationary, but fluctuates during anesthesia and
between different vigilance states.

To survive in an ever-changing environment, the brain must seamlessly integrate a
rich stream of incoming information into coherent internal representations that
can then be used to efficiently plan for action. The brain must, however, balance
its ability to integrate information from various sources with a complementary
capacity to segregate information into modules which perform specialized
computations in local circuits. Importantly, evidence suggests that imbalances in
the brain's ability to bind together and/or segregate information over both space
and time is a common feature of several neuropsychiatric disorders. Most studies 
have, however, until recently strictly attempted to characterize the principles
of integration and segregation in static (i.e. time-invariant) representations of
human brain networks, hence disregarding the complex spatio-temporal nature of
these processes. In the present Review, we describe how the emerging discipline
of whole-brain computational connectomics may be used to study the causal
mechanisms of the integration and segregation of information on behaviourally
relevant timescales. We emphasize how novel methods from network science and
whole-brain computational modelling can expand beyond traditional neuroimaging
paradigms and help to uncover the neurobiological determinants of the abnormal
integration and segregation of information in neuropsychiatric disorders.This
article is part of the themed issue 'Mathematical methods in medicine:
neuroscience, cardiology and pathology'.

The brain during healthy aging exhibits gradual deterioration of structure but
maintains a high level of cognitive ability. These structural changes are often
accompanied by reorganization of functional brain networks. Existing
neurocognitive theories of aging have argued that such changes are either
beneficial or detrimental. Despite numerous empirical investigations, the field
lacks a coherent account of the dynamic processes that occur over our lifespan.
Taking advantage of the recent developments in whole-brain computational modeling
approaches, we hypothesize that the continuous process of aging can be explained 
by the concepts of metastability - a theoretical framework that gives a
systematic account of the variability of the brain. This hypothesis can bridge
the gap between existing theories and the empirical findings on age-related
changes.

OBJECTIVE: We introduce a method that quantifies the consistent involvement of
intracranially monitored regions in recurrent focal seizures.
METHODS: We evaluated the consistency of two ictal spectral activation patterns
(mean power change and power change onset time) in intracranial recordings across
focal seizures from seven patients with clinically marked seizure onset zone
(SOZ). We examined SOZ discrimination using both patterns in different frequency 
bands and periods of interest.
RESULTS: Activation patterns were proved to be consistent across more than 80% of
recurrent ictal epochs. In all patients, whole-seizure mean activations were
significantly higher for SOZ than non-SOZ regions (P<0.05) while activation onset
times were significantly lower for SOZ than for non-SOZ regions (P<0.001) in six 
patients. Alpha-beta bands (8-20Hz) achieved the highest patient-average effect
size on the whole-seizure period while gamma band (20-70Hz) achieved the highest 
discrimination values between SOZ and non-SOZ sites near seizure onset (0-5s).
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent spectral activation patterns in focal epilepsies
discriminate the SOZ with high effect sizes upon appropriate selection of
frequency bands and activation periods.
SIGNIFICANCE: The present method may be used to improve epileptogenic
identification as well as pinpoint additional regions that are functionally
altered during ictal events.

Over the last decade, we have observed a revolution in brain structural and
functional Connectomics. On one hand, we have an ever-more detailed
characterization of the brain's white matter structural connectome. On the other,
we have a repertoire of consistent functional networks that form and dissipate
over time during rest. Despite the evident spatial similarities between
structural and functional connectivity, understanding how different time-evolving
functional networks spontaneously emerge from a single structural network
requires analyzing the problem from the perspective of complex network dynamics
and dynamical system's theory. In that direction, bottom-up computational models 
are useful tools to test theoretical scenarios and depict the mechanisms at the
genesis of resting-state activity. Here, we provide an overview of the different 
mechanistic scenarios proposed over the last decade via computational models.
Importantly, we highlight the need of incorporating additional model constraints 
considering the properties observed at finer temporal scales with MEG and the
dynamical properties of FC in order to refresh the list of candidate scenarios.

While several studies have shown that focal lesions affect the communication
between structurally normal regions of the brain, and that these changes may
correlate with behavioural deficits, their impact on brain's information
processing capacity is currently unknown. Here we test the hypothesis that focal 
lesions decrease the brain's information processing capacity, of which changes in
functional connectivity may be a measurable correlate. To measure processing
capacity, we turned to whole brain computational modelling to estimate the
integration and segregation of information in brain networks. First, we measured 
functional connectivity between different brain areas with resting state
functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy subjects (n = 26), and subjects 
who had suffered a cortical stroke (n = 36). We then used a whole-brain network
model that coupled average excitatory activities of local regions via anatomical 
connectivity. Model parameters were optimized in each healthy or stroke
participant to maximize correlation between model and empirical functional
connectivity, so that the model's effective connectivity was a veridical
representation of healthy or lesioned brain networks. Subsequently, we calculated
two model-based measures: 'integration', a graph theoretical measure obtained
from functional connectivity, which measures the connectedness of brain networks,
and 'information capacity', an information theoretical measure that cannot be
obtained empirically, representative of the segregative ability of brain networks
to encode distinct stimuli. We found that both measures were decreased in stroke 
patients, as compared to healthy controls, particularly at the level of
resting-state networks. Furthermore, we found that these measures, especially
information capacity, correlate with measures of behavioural impairment and the
segregation of resting-state networks empirically measured. This study shows that
focal lesions affect the brain's ability to represent stimuli and task states,
and that information capacity measured through whole brain models is a
theory-driven measure of processing capacity that could be used as a biomarker of
injury for outcome prediction or target for rehabilitation intervention.

During rest, envelopes of band-limited on-going MEG signals co-vary across the
brain in consistent patterns, which have been related to resting-state networks
measured with fMRI. To investigate the genesis of such envelope correlations, we 
consider a whole-brain network model assuming two distinct fundamental scenarios:
one where each brain area generates oscillations in a single frequency, and a
novel one where each brain area can generate oscillations in multiple frequency
bands. The models share, as a common generator of damped oscillations, the normal
form of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation operating at the critical border between
the steady state and the oscillatory regime. The envelopes of the simulated
signals are compared with empirical MEG data using new methods to analyse the
envelope dynamics in terms of their phase coherence and stability across the
spectrum of carrier frequencies. Considering the whole-brain model with a single 
frequency generator in each brain area, we obtain the best fit with the empirical
MEG data when the fundamental frequency is tuned at 12Hz. However, when multiple 
frequency generators are placed at each local brain area, we obtain an improved
fit of the spatio-temporal structure of on-going MEG data across all frequency
bands. Our results indicate that the brain is likely to operate on multiple
frequency channels during rest, introducing a novel dimension for future models
of large-scale brain activity.

The uncertain option task has been recently adopted to investigate the neural
systems underlying the decision confidence. Latterly single neurons activity has 
been recorded in lateral intraparietal cortex of monkeys performing an uncertain 
option task, where the subject is allowed to opt for a small but sure reward
instead of making a risky perceptual decision. We propose a multiple choice model
implemented in a discrete attractors network. This model is able to reproduce
both behavioral and neurophysiological experimental data and therefore provides
support to the numerous perspectives that interpret the uncertain option task as 
a sensory-motor association. The model explains the behavioral and neural data
recorded in monkeys as the result of the multistable attractor landscape and
produces several testable predictions. One of these predictions may help
distinguish our model from a recently proposed continuous attractor model.

Cognition is hypothesized to require the globally coordinated, functionally
relevant integration of otherwise segregated information processing carried out
by specialized brain regions. Studies of the macroscopic connectome as well as
recent neuroimaging and neuromodeling research have suggested a densely connected
collective of cortical hubs, termed the rich club, to provide a central workspace
for such integration. In order for rich club regions to fulfill this role they
must dispose of a dynamic mechanism by which they can actively shape networks of 
brain regions whose information processing needs to be integrated. A potential
candidate for such a mechanism comes in the form of oscillations which might be
employed to establish communication channels among relevant brain regions. We
explore this possibility using an integrative approach combining whole-brain
computational modeling with neuroimaging, wherein we investigate the local
dynamics model brain regions need to exhibit in order to fit (dynamic) network
behavior empirically observed for resting as well as a range of task states. We
find that rich club regions largely exhibit oscillations during task performance 
but not during rest. Furthermore, oscillations exhibited by rich club regions can
harmonize a set of asynchronous brain regions thus supporting functional coupling
among them. These findings are in line with the hypothesis that the rich club can
actively shape integration using oscillations.

The large-scale structural ingredients of the brain and neural connectomes have
been identified in recent years. These are, similar to the features found in many
other real networks: the arrangement of brain regions into modules and the
presence of highly connected regions (hubs) forming rich-clubs. Here, we examine 
how modules and hubs shape the collective dynamics on networks and we find that
both ingredients lead to the emergence of complex dynamics. Comparing the
connectomes of C. elegans, cats, macaques and humans to surrogate networks in
which either modules or hubs are destroyed, we find that functional complexity
always decreases in the perturbed networks. A comparison between simulated and
empirically obtained resting-state functional connectivity indicates that the
human brain, at rest, lies in a dynamical state that reflects the largest
complexity its anatomical connectome can host. Last, we generalise the topology
of neural connectomes into a new hierarchical network model that successfully
combines modular organisation with rich-club forming hubs. This is achieved by
centralising the cross-modular connections through a preferential attachment
rule. Our network model hosts more complex dynamics than other hierarchical
models widely used as benchmarks.

Hosting nearly eighty percent of all human neurons, the cerebellum is
functionally connected to large regions of the brain. Accumulating data suggest
that some cerebellar resting-state alterations may constitute a key candidate
mechanism for depressive psychopathology. While there is some evidence linking
cerebellar function and depression, two topics remain largely unexplored. First, 
the genetic or environmental roots of this putative association have not been
elicited. Secondly, while different mathematical representations of resting-state
fMRI patterns can embed diverse information of relevance for health and disease, 
many of them have not been studied in detail regarding the cerebellum and
depression. Here, high-resolution fMRI scans were examined to estimate functional
connectivity patterns across twenty-six cerebellar regions in a sample of 48
identical twins (24 pairs) informative for depression liability. A network-based 
statistic approach was employed to analyze cerebellar functional networks built
using three methods: the conventional approach of filtered BOLD fMRI time-series,
and two analytic components of this oscillatory activity (amplitude envelope and 
instantaneous phase). The findings indicate that some environmental factors may
lead to depression vulnerability through alterations of the neural oscillatory
activity of the cerebellum during resting-state. These effects may be observed
particularly when exploring the amplitude envelope of fMRI oscillations.

In recent years, the application of network analysis to neuroimaging data has
provided useful insights about the brain's functional and structural organization
in both health and disease. This has proven a significant paradigm shift from the
study of individual brain regions in isolation. Graph-based models of the brain
consist of vertices, which represent distinct brain areas, and edges which encode
the presence (or absence) of a structural or functional relationship between each
pair of vertices. By definition, any graph metric will be defined upon this
dyadic representation of the brain activity. It is however unclear to what extent
these dyadic relationships can capture the brain's complex functional
architecture and the encoding of information in distributed networks. Moreover,
because network representations of global brain activity are derived from
measures that have a continuous response (i.e., interregional BOLD signals), it
is methodologically complex to characterize the architecture of functional
networks using traditional graph-based approaches. In the present study, we
investigate the relationship between standard network metrics computed from
dyadic interactions in a functional network, and a metric defined on the
persistence homological scaffold of the network, which is a summary of the
persistent homology structure of resting-state fMRI data. The persistence
homological scaffold is a summary network that differs in important ways from the
standard network representations of functional neuroimaging data: (i) it is
constructed using the information from all edge weights comprised in the original
network without applying an ad hoc threshold and (ii) as a summary of persistent 
homology, it considers the contributions of simplicial structures to the network 
organization rather than dyadic edge-vertices interactions. We investigated the
information domain captured by the persistence homological scaffold by computing 
the strength of each node in the scaffold and comparing it to local graph metrics
traditionally employed in neuroimaging studies. We conclude that the persistence 
scaffold enables the identification of network elements that may support the
functional integration of information across distributed brain networks.

In order to promote survival through flexible cognition and goal-directed
behaviour, the brain has to optimize segregation and integration of information
into coherent, distributed dynamical states. Certain organizational features of
the brain have been proposed to be essential to facilitate cognitive flexibility,
especially hub regions in the so-called rich club which show dense
interconnectivity. These structural hubs have been suggested to be vital for
integration and segregation of information. Yet, this has not been evaluated in
terms of resulting functional temporal dynamics. A complementary measure covering
the temporal aspects of functional connectivity could thus bring new insights
into a more complete picture of the integrative nature of brain networks. Here,
we use causal whole-brain computational modelling to determine the functional
dynamical significance of the rich club and compare this to a new measure of the 
most functionally relevant brain regions for binding information over time
("dynamical workspace of binding nodes"). We found that removal of the
iteratively generated workspace of binding nodes impacts significantly more on
measures of integration and encoding of information capability than the removal
of the rich club regions. While the rich club procedure produced almost half of
the binding nodes, the remaining nodes have low degree yet still play a
significant role in the workspace essential for binding information over time and
as such goes beyond a description of the structural backbone.

Humans have a remarkable ability to reflect upon their behavior and mental
processes, a capacity known as metacognition. Recent neurophysiological
experiments have attempted to elucidate the neural correlates of metacognition in
other species. Despite this increased attention, there is still no operational
definition of metacognition and the ability of behavioral tasks to reflect
metacognition is the subject of debate. The most widely used task for studying
metacognition in animals, the uncertain-option task, has been criticized because 
it can be solved by simple associative mechanisms. Here we propose a broad
perspective that generalizes those critiques to another task, post-decision
wagering. Moreover, we extend this critical view to account for recent
neurophysiological evidence. We argue these tasks are simple enough that any
animal could solve them using very simple mechanisms such as sensory-motor
associations. In this case, it is impossible to know whether all animals are
metacognitive, or if the tasks are simply not appropriate. Therefore, we suggest 
using better defined concepts until a suitable task for metacognition is
available.

Most models of lexical access assume that bilingual speakers activate their two
languages even when they are in a context in which only one language is used. A
critical piece of evidence used to support this notion is the observation that a 
given word automatically activates its translation equivalent in the other
language. Here, we argue that these findings are compatible with a different
account, in which bilinguals "carry over" the structure of their native language 
to the non-native language during learning, and where there is no activation of
translation equivalents. To demonstrate this, we describe a model in which
language learning involves mapping native language phonological relationships to 
the non-native language, and we show how it can explain the results attributed to
automatic activation of translation equivalents.

Single neurons in the primate orbitofrontal cortex respond when an expected
reward is not obtained, and behaviour must change. The human lateral
orbitofrontal cortex is activated when non-reward, or loss occurs. The neuronal
computation of this negative reward prediction error is fundamental for the
emotional changes associated with non-reward, and with changing behaviour. Little
is known about the neuronal mechanism. Here we propose a mechanism, which we
formalize into a neuronal network model, which is simulated to enable the
operation of the mechanism to be investigated. A single attractor network has a
reward population (or pool) of neurons that is activated by expected reward, and 
maintain their firing until, after a time, synaptic depression reduces the firing
rate in this neuronal population. If a reward outcome is not received, the
decreasing firing in the reward neurons releases the inhibition implemented by
inhibitory neurons, and this results in a second population of non-reward neurons
to start and continue firing encouraged by the spiking-related noise in the
network. If a reward outcome is received, this keeps the reward attractor active,
and this through the inhibitory neurons prevents the non-reward attractor neurons
from being activated. If an expected reward has been signalled, and the reward
attractor neurons are active, their firing can be directly inhibited by a
non-reward outcome, and the non-reward neurons become activated because the
inhibition on them is released. The neuronal mechanisms in the orbitofrontal
cortex for computing negative reward prediction error are important, for this
system may be over-reactive in depression, under-reactive in impulsive behaviour,
and may influence the dopaminergic 'prediction error' neurons.

Multi-electrode recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) provide the
opportunity to investigate the spatiotemporal organization of neural activity on 
the scale of several millimeters. In particular, the phases of oscillatory LFPs
allow studying the coordination of neural oscillations in time and space and to
tie it to cognitive processing. Given the computational roles of LFP phases, it
is important to know how they relate to the phases of the underlying current
source densities (CSDs) that generate them. Although CSDs and LFPs are distinct
physical quantities, they are often (implicitly) identified when interpreting
experimental observations. That this identification is problematic is clear from 
the fact that LFP phases change when switching to different electrode montages,
while the underlying CSD phases remain unchanged. In this study we use a
volume-conductor model to characterize discrepancies between LFP and CSD
phase-patterns, to identify the contributing factors, and to assess the effect of
different electrode montages. Although we focus on cortical LFPs recorded with
two-dimensional (Utah) arrays, our findings are also relevant for other electrode
configurations. We found that the main factors that determine the discrepancy
between CSD and LFP phase-patterns are the frequency of the neural oscillations
and the extent to which the laminar CSD profile is balanced. Furthermore, the
presence of laminar phase-differences in cortical oscillations, as commonly
observed in experiments, precludes identifying LFP phases with those of the CSD
oscillations at a given cortical depth. This observation potentially complicates 
the interpretation of spike-LFP coherence and spike-triggered LFP averages. With 
respect to reference strategies, we found that the average-reference montage
leads to larger discrepancies between LFP and CSD phases as compared with the
referential montage, while the Laplacian montage reduces these discrepancies. We 
therefore advice to conduct analysis of two-dimensional LFP recordings using the 
Laplacian montage.

How do you make a decision if you do not know the rules of the game? Models of
sensory decision-making suggest that choices are slow if evidence is weak, but
they may only apply if the subject knows the task rules. Here, we asked how the
learning of a new rule influences neuronal activity in the visual (area V1) and
frontal cortex (area FEF) of monkeys. We devised a new icon-selection task. On
each day, the monkeys saw 2 new icons (small pictures) and learned which one was 
relevant. We rewarded eye movements to a saccade target connected to the relevant
icon with a curve. Neurons in visual and frontal cortex coded the monkey's
choice, because the representation of the selected curve was enhanced. Learning
delayed the neuronal selection signals and we uncovered the cause of this delay
in V1, where learning to select the relevant icon caused an early suppression of 
surrounding image elements. These results demonstrate that the learning of a new 
rule causes a transition from fast and random decisions to a more considerate
strategy that takes additional time and they reveal the contribution of visual
and frontal cortex to the learning process.

Computational modeling of the spontaneous dynamics over the whole brain provides 
critical insight into the spatiotemporal organization of brain dynamics at
multiple resolutions and their alteration to changes in brain structure (e.g. in 
diseased states, aging, across individuals). Recent experimental evidence further
suggests that the adverse effect of lesions is visible on spontaneous dynamics
characterized by changes in resting state functional connectivity and its graph
theoretical properties (e.g. modularity). These changes originate from altered
neural dynamics in individual brain areas that are otherwise poised towards a
homeostatic equilibrium to maintain a stable excitatory and inhibitory activity. 
In this work, we employ a homeostatic inhibitory mechanism, balancing excitation 
and inhibition in the local brain areas of the entire cortex under neurological
impairments like lesions to understand global functional recovery (across brain
networks and individuals). Previous computational and empirical studies have
demonstrated that the resting state functional connectivity varies primarily due 
to the location and specific topological characteristics of the lesion. We show
that local homeostatic balance provides a functional recovery by re-establishing 
excitation-inhibition balance in all areas that are affected by lesion. We
systematically compare the extent of recovery in the primary hub areas (e.g.
default mode network (DMN), medial temporal lobe, medial prefrontal cortex) as
well as other sensory areas like primary motor area, supplementary motor area,
fronto-parietal and temporo-parietal networks. Our findings suggest that
stability and richness similar to the normal brain dynamics at rest are
achievable by re-establishment of balance.

Resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) has become a useful tool to investigate the
connectivity structure of mental health disorders. In the case of major
depressive disorder (MDD), recent studies regarding the RS-fMRI have found
abnormal connectivity in several regions of the brain, particularly in the
default mode network (DMN). Thus, the relevance of the DMN to self-referential
thoughts and ruminations has made the use of the resting-state approach
particularly important for MDD. The majority of such research has relied on the
grand averaged functional connectivity measures based on the temporal
correlations between the BOLD time series of various brain regions. We, in our
study, investigated the variations in the functional connectivity over time at
global and local level using RS-fMRI BOLD time series of 27 MDD patients and 27
healthy control subjects. We found that global synchronization and temporal
stability were significantly increased in the MDD patients. Furthermore, the
participants with MDD showed significantly increased overall average (static)
functional connectivity (sFC) but decreased variability of functional
connectivity (vFC) within specific networks. Static FC increased to predominance 
among the regions pertaining to the default mode network (DMN), while the
decreased variability of FC was observed in the connections between the DMN and
the frontoparietal network. Hum Brain Mapp 37:2918-2930, 2016. © 2016 Wiley

The brain exhibits complex spatio-temporal patterns of activity. This phenomenon 
is governed by an interplay between the internal neural dynamics of cortical
areas and their connectivity. Uncovering this complex relationship has raised
much interest, both for theory and the interpretation of experimental data (e.g.,
fMRI recordings) using dynamical models. Here we focus on the so-called inverse
problem: the inference of network parameters in a cortical model to reproduce
empirically observed activity. Although it has received a lot of interest,
recovering directed connectivity for large networks has been rather unsuccessful 
so far. The present study specifically addresses this point for a noise-diffusion
network model. We develop a Lyapunov optimization that iteratively tunes the
network connectivity in order to reproduce second-order moments of the node
activity, or functional connectivity. We show theoretically and numerically that 
the use of covariances with both zero and non-zero time shifts is the key to
infer directed connectivity. The first main theoretical finding is that an
accurate estimation of the underlying network connectivity requires that the time
shift for covariances is matched with the time constant of the dynamical system. 
In addition to the network connectivity, we also adjust the intrinsic noise
received by each network node. The framework is applied to experimental fMRI data
recorded for subjects at rest. Diffusion-weighted MRI data provide an estimate of
anatomical connections, which is incorporated to constrain the cortical model.
The empirical covariance structure is reproduced faithfully, especially its
temporal component (i.e., time-shifted covariances) in addition to the spatial
component that is usually the focus of studies. We find that the cortical
interactions, referred to as effective connectivity, in the tuned model are not
reciprocal. In particular, hubs are either receptors or feeders: they do not
exhibit both strong incoming and outgoing connections. Our results sets a
quantitative ground to explore the propagation of activity in the cortex.

The feasibility to use functional MRI (fMRI) during natural sleep to assess
low-frequency basal brain activity fluctuations in human neonates has been
demonstrated, although its potential to characterise pathologies of prenatal
origin has not yet been exploited. In the present study, we used intrauterine
growth restriction (IUGR) as a model of altered neurodevelopment due to prenatal 
condition to show the suitability of brain networks to characterise functional
brain organisation at neonatal age. Particularly, we analysed resting-state fMRI 
signal of 20 neonates with IUGR and 13 controls, obtaining whole-brain functional
networks based on correlations of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in
90 grey matter regions of an anatomical atlas (AAL). Characterisation of the
networks obtained with graph theoretical features showed increased network
infrastructure and raw efficiencies but reduced efficiency after normalisation,
demonstrating hyper-connected but sub-optimally organised IUGR functional brain
networks. Significant association of network features with neurobehavioral scores
was also found. Further assessment of spatiotemporal dynamics displayed
alterations into features associated to frontal, cingulate and lingual cortices. 
These findings show the capacity of functional brain networks to characterise
brain reorganisation from an early age, and their potential to develop biomarkers
of altered neurodevelopment.

Models that integrate sensory evidence to a threshold can explain task accuracy, 
response times and confidence, yet it is still unclear how confidence is encoded 
in the brain. Classic models assume that confidence is encoded in some form of
balance between the evidence integrated in favor and against the selected option.
However, recent experiments that measure the sensory evidence's influence on
choice and confidence contradict these classic models. We propose that the
decision is taken by many loosely coupled modules each of which represent a
stochastic sample of the sensory evidence integral. Confidence is then encoded in
the dispersion between modules. We show that our proposal can account for the
well established relations between confidence, and stimuli discriminability and
reaction times, as well as the fluctuations influence on choice and confidence.

The default mode network (DMN) is a commonly observed resting-state network (RSN)
that includes medial temporal, parietal, and prefrontal regions involved in
episodic memory [1-3]. The behavioral relevance of endogenous DMN activity
remains elusive, despite an emerging literature correlating resting fMRI
fluctuations with memory performance [4, 5]-particularly in DMN regions [6-8].
Mechanistic support for the DMN's role in memory consolidation might come from
investigation of large deflections (sharp-waves) in the hippocampal local field
potential that co-occur with high-frequency (>80 Hz) oscillations called
ripples-both during sleep [9, 10] and awake deliberative periods [11-13]. Ripples
are ideally suited for memory consolidation [14, 15], since the reactivation of
hippocampal place cell ensembles occurs during ripples [16-19]. Moreover, the
number of ripples after learning predicts subsequent memory performance in
rodents [20-22] and humans [23], whereas electrical stimulation of the
hippocampus after learning interferes with memory consolidation [24-26]. A recent
study in macaques showed diffuse fMRI neocortical activation and subcortical
deactivation specifically after ripples [27]. Yet it is unclear whether ripples
and other hippocampal neural events influence endogenous fluctuations in specific
RSNs-like the DMN-unitarily. Here, we examine fMRI datasets from anesthetized
monkeys with simultaneous hippocampal electrophysiology recordings, where we
observe a dramatic increase in the DMN fMRI signal following ripples, but not
following other hippocampal electrophysiological events. Crucially, we find
increases in ongoing DMN activity after ripples, but not in other RSNs. Our
results relate endogenous DMN fluctuations to hippocampal ripples, thereby
linking network-level resting fMRI fluctuations with behaviorally relevant
circuit-level neural dynamics.

Understanding the mechanisms for communication in the brain remains one of the
most challenging scientific questions. The communication through coherence (CTC) 
hypothesis was originally proposed 10 years ago, stating that two groups of
neurons communicate most effectively when their excitability fluctuations are
coordinated in time (i.e., coherent), and this control by cortical coherence is a
fundamental brain mechanism for large-scale, distant communication. In light of
new evidence from whole-brain computational modelling of multimodal neuroimaging 
data, we link CTC to the concept of metastability, which refers to a rich
exploration of the functional repertoire made possible by the underlying
structural whole-brain connectivity.

Cortical networks, in-vitro as well as in-vivo, can spontaneously generate a
variety of collective dynamical events such as network spikes, UP and DOWN
states, global oscillations, and avalanches. Though each of them has been
variously recognized in previous works as expression of the excitability of the
cortical tissue and the associated nonlinear dynamics, a unified picture of the
determinant factors (dynamical and architectural) is desirable and not yet
available. Progress has also been partially hindered by the use of a variety of
statistical measures to define the network events of interest. We propose here a 
common probabilistic definition of network events that, applied to the firing
activity of cultured neural networks, highlights the co-occurrence of network
spikes, power-law distributed avalanches, and exponentially distributed
'quasi-orbits', which offer a third type of collective behavior. A rate model,
including synaptic excitation and inhibition with no imposed topology, synaptic
short-term depression, and finite-size noise, accounts for all these different,
coexisting phenomena. We find that their emergence is largely regulated by the
proximity to an oscillatory instability of the dynamics, where the non-linear
excitable behavior leads to a self-amplification of activity fluctuations over a 
wide range of scales in space and time. In this sense, the cultured network
dynamics is compatible with an excitation-inhibition balance corresponding to a
slightly sub-critical regime. Finally, we propose and test a method to infer the 
characteristic time of the fatigue process, from the observed time course of the 
network's firing rate. Unlike the model, possessing a single fatigue mechanism,
the cultured network appears to show multiple time scales, signalling the
possible coexistence of different fatigue mechanisms.

Estimating the difficulty of a decision is a fundamental process to elaborate
complex and adaptive behaviour. In this paper, we show that the movement time of 
behaving monkeys performing a decision-making task is correlated with decision
difficulty and that the activity of a population of neurons in ventral Premotor
cortex correlates with the movement time. Moreover, we found another population
of neurons that encodes the discriminability of the stimulus, thereby supplying
another source of information about the difficulty of the decision. The activity 
of neurons encoding the difficulty can be produced by very different
computations. Therefore, we show that decision difficulty can be encoded through 
three different mechanisms: 1. Switch time coding, 2. rate coding and 3. binary
coding. This rich representation reflects the basis of different functional
aspects of difficulty in the making of a decision and the possible role of
difficulty estimation in complex decision scenarios.

Slowness of thought is not necessarily a handicap but could be a signature of
optimal brain function. Emerging evidence shows that neuroanatomical and
dynamical constraints of the human brain shape its functionality in optimal ways,
characterized by slowness during task-based cognition in the context of
spontaneous resting-state activity. This activity can be described
mechanistically by whole-brain computational modeling that relates directly to
optimality in the context of theories arguing for metastability in the brain. We 
discuss the role for optimal processing of information in the context of
cognitive, task-related activity, and propose that combining multi-modal
neuroimaging and explicit whole-brain models focused on the timing of functional 
dynamics can help to uncover fundamental rules of brain function in health and
disease.

How a stimulus or a task alters the spontaneous dynamics of the brain remains a
fundamental open question in neuroscience. One of the most robust hallmarks of
task/stimulus-driven brain dynamics is the decrease of variability with respect
to the spontaneous level, an effect seen across multiple experimental conditions 
and in brain signals observed at different spatiotemporal scales. Recently, it
was observed that the trial-to-trial variability and temporal variance of
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals decrease in the task-driven 
activity. Here we examined the dynamics of a large-scale model of the human
cortex to provide a mechanistic understanding of these observations. The model
allows computing the statistics of synaptic activity in the spontaneous condition
and in putative tasks determined by external inputs to a given subset of brain
regions. We demonstrated that external inputs decrease the variance, increase the
covariances, and decrease the autocovariance of synaptic activity as a
consequence of single node and large-scale network dynamics. Altogether, these
changes in network statistics imply a reduction of entropy, meaning that the
spontaneous synaptic activity outlines a larger multidimensional activity space
than does the task-driven activity. We tested this model's prediction on fMRI
signals from healthy humans acquired during rest and task conditions and found a 
significant decrease of entropy in the stimulus-driven activity. Altogether, our 
study proposes a mechanism for increasing the information capacity of brain
networks by enlarging the volume of possible activity configurations at rest and 
reliably settling into a confined stimulus-driven state to allow better
transmission of stimulus-related information.

It is unclear whether Hebbian-like learning occurs at the level of long-range
white matter connections in humans, i.e., where measurable changes in structural 
connectivity (SC) are correlated with changes in functional connectivity.
However, the behavioral changes observed after deep brain stimulation (DBS)
suggest the existence of such Hebbian-like mechanisms occurring at the structural
level with functional consequences. In this rare case study, we obtained the full
network of white matter connections of one patient with Parkinson's disease (PD) 
before and after long-term DBS and combined it with a computational model of
ongoing activity to investigate the effects of DBS-induced long-term structural
changes. The results show that the long-term effects of DBS on resting-state
functional connectivity is best obtained in the computational model by changing
the structural weights from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) to the putamen and the 
thalamus in a Hebbian-like manner. Moreover, long-term DBS also significantly
changed the SC towards normality in terms of model-based measures of segregation 
and integration of information processing, two key concepts of brain
organization. This novel approach using computational models to model the effects
of Hebbian-like changes in SC allowed us to causally identify the possible
underlying neural mechanisms of long-term DBS using rare case study data. In
time, this could help predict the efficacy of individual DBS targeting and
identify novel DBS targets.

Recent findings indicate that alterations of the amygdalar resting-state fMRI
connectivity play an important role in the etiology of depression. While both
depression and resting-state brain activity are shaped by genes and environment, 
the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors mediating the
relationship between amygdalar resting-state connectivity and depression remain
largely unexplored. Likewise, novel neuroimaging research indicates that
different mathematical representations of resting-state fMRI activity patterns
are able to embed distinct information relevant to brain health and disease. The 
present study analyzed the influence of genes and environment on amygdalar
resting-state fMRI connectivity, in relation to depression risk. High-resolution 
resting-state fMRI scans were analyzed to estimate functional connectivity
patterns in a sample of 48 twins (24 monozygotic pairs) informative for
depressive psychopathology (6 concordant, 8 discordant and 10 healthy control
pairs). A graph-theoretical framework was employed to construct brain networks
using two methods: (i) the conventional approach of filtered BOLD fMRI
time-series and (ii) analytic components of this fMRI activity. Results using
both methods indicate that depression risk is increased by environmental factors 
altering amygdalar connectivity. When analyzing the analytic components of the
BOLD fMRI time-series, genetic factors altering the amygdala neural activity at
rest show an important contribution to depression risk. Overall, these findings
show that both genes and environment modify different patterns the amygdala
resting-state connectivity to increase depression risk. The genetic relationship 
between amygdalar connectivity and depression may be better elicited by examining
analytic components of the brain resting-state BOLD fMRI signals.

The brain regulates information flow by balancing the segregation and integration
of incoming stimuli to facilitate flexible cognition and behaviour. The
topological features of brain networks--in particular, network communities and
hubs--support this segregation and integration but do not provide information
about how external inputs are processed dynamically (that is, over time).
Experiments in which the consequences of selective inputs on brain activity are
controlled and traced with great precision could provide such information.
However, such strategies have thus far had limited success. By contrast, recent
whole-brain computational modelling approaches have enabled us to start assessing
the effect of input perturbations on brain dynamics in silico.

Children who sustain a prenatal or perinatal brain injury in the form of a stroke
develop remarkably normal cognitive functions in certain areas, with a particular
strength in language skills. A dominant explanation for this is that brain
regions from the contralesional hemisphere "take over" their functions, whereas
the damaged areas and other ipsilesional regions play much less of a role.
However, it is difficult to tease apart whether changes in neural activity after 
early brain injury are due to damage caused by the lesion or by processes related
to postinjury reorganization. We sought to differentiate between these two causes
by investigating the functional connectivity (FC) of brain areas during the
resting state in human children with early brain injury using a computational
model. We simulated a large-scale network consisting of realistic models of local
brain areas coupled through anatomical connectivity information of healthy and
injured participants. We then compared the resulting simulated FC values of
healthy and injured participants with the empirical ones. We found that the
empirical connectivity values, especially of the damaged areas, correlated better
with simulated values of a healthy brain than those of an injured brain. This
result indicates that the structural damage caused by an early brain injury is
unlikely to have an adverse and sustained impact on the functional connections,
albeit during the resting state, of damaged areas. Therefore, these areas could
continue to play a role in the development of near-normal function in certain
domains such as language in these children.

Neural correlations during a cognitive task are central to study brain
information processing and computation. However, they have been poorly analyzed
due to the difficulty of recording simultaneous single neurons during task
performance. In the present work, we quantified neural directional correlations
using spike trains that were simultaneously recorded in sensory, premotor, and
motor cortical areas of two monkeys during a somatosensory discrimination task.
Upon modeling spike trains as binary time series, we used a nonparametric
Bayesian method to estimate pairwise directional correlations between many pairs 
of neurons throughout different stages of the task, namely, perception, working
memory, decision making, and motor report. We find that solving the task involves
feedforward and feedback correlation paths linking sensory and motor areas during
certain task intervals. Specifically, information is communicated by task-driven 
neural correlations that are significantly delayed across secondary somatosensory
cortex, premotor, and motor areas when decision making takes place. Crucially,
when sensory comparison is no longer requested for task performance, a major
proportion of directional correlations consistently vanish across all cortical
areas.

Intrinsic brain activity is characterized by the presence of highly structured
networks of correlated fluctuations between different regions of the brain. Such 
networks encompass different functions, whose properties are known to be
modulated by the ongoing global brain state and are altered in several
neurobiological disorders. In the present study, we induced a deep state of
anesthesia in rats by means of a ketamine/medetomidine peritoneal injection, and 
analyzed the time course of the correlation between the brain activity in
different areas while anesthesia spontaneously decreased over time. We compared
results separately obtained from fMRI and local field potentials (LFPs) under the
same anesthesia protocol, finding that while most profound phases of anesthesia
can be described by overall sparse connectivity, stereotypical activity and poor 
functional integration, during lighter states different frequency-specific
functional networks emerge, endowing the gradual restoration of structured
large-scale activity seen during rest. Noteworthy, our in vivo results show that 
those areas belonging to the same functional network (the default-mode) exhibited
sustained correlated oscillations around 10Hz throughout the protocol, suggesting
the presence of a specific functional backbone that is preserved even during
deeper phases of anesthesia. Finally, the overall pattern of results obtained
from both imaging and in vivo-recordings suggests that the progressive emergence 
from deep anesthesia is reflected by a corresponding gradual increase of
organized correlated oscillations across the cortex.

BrainX(3) is a large-scale simulation of human brain activity with real-time
interaction, rendered in 3D in a virtual reality environment, which combines
computational power with human intuition for the exploration and analysis of
complex dynamical networks. We ground this simulation on structural connectivity 
obtained from diffusion spectrum imaging data and model it on neuronal population
dynamics. Users can interact with BrainX(3) in real-time by perturbing brain
regions with transient stimulations to observe reverberating network activity,
simulate lesion dynamics or implement network analysis functions from a library
of graph theoretic measures. BrainX(3) can thus be used as a novel immersive
platform for exploration and analysis of dynamical activity patterns in brain
networks, both at rest or in a task-related state, for discovery of signaling
pathways associated to brain function and/or dysfunction and as a tool for
virtual neurosurgery. Our results demonstrate these functionalities and shed
insight on the dynamics of the resting-state attractor. Specifically, we found
that a noisy network seems to favor a low firing attractor state. We also found
that the dynamics of a noisy network is less resilient to lesions. Our
simulations on TMS perturbations show that even though TMS inhibits most of the
network, it also sparsely excites a few regions. This is presumably due to
anti-correlations in the dynamics and suggests that even a lesioned network can
show sparsely distributed increased activity compared to healthy resting-state,
over specific brain areas.

Spatial patterns of coherent activity across different brain areas have been
identified during the resting-state fluctuations of the brain. However, recent
studies indicate that resting-state activity is not stationary, but shows complex
temporal dynamics. We were interested in the spatiotemporal dynamics of the phase
interactions among resting-state fMRI BOLD signals from human subjects. We found 
that the global phase synchrony of the BOLD signals evolves on a characteristic
ultra-slow (<0.01Hz) time scale, and that its temporal variations reflect the
transient formation and dissolution of multiple communities of synchronized brain
regions. Synchronized communities reoccurred intermittently in time and across
scanning sessions. We found that the synchronization communities relate to
previously defined functional networks known to be engaged in sensory-motor or
cognitive function, called resting-state networks (RSNs), including the default
mode network, the somato-motor network, the visual network, the auditory network,
the cognitive control networks, the self-referential network, and combinations of
these and other RSNs. We studied the mechanism originating the observed
spatiotemporal synchronization dynamics by using a network model of phase
oscillators connected through the brain's anatomical connectivity estimated using
diffusion imaging human data. The model consistently approximates the temporal
and spatial synchronization patterns of the empirical data, and reveals that
multiple clusters that transiently synchronize and desynchronize emerge from the 
complex topology of anatomical connections, provided that oscillators are
heterogeneous.

The relatively random spiking times of individual neurons provide a source of
noise in the brain. We show how this noise interacting with altered depth in the 
basins of attraction of networks involved in short-term memory, attention, and
episodic memory provide an approach to understanding some of the cognitive
changes in normal aging. The effects of the neurobiological changes in aging that
are considered include reduced synaptic modification and maintenance during
learning produced in part through reduced acetylcholine in normal aging, reduced 
dopamine which reduces NMDA-receptor mediated effects, reduced noradrenaline
which increases cAMP and thus shunts excitatory synaptic inputs, and the effects 
of a reduction in acetylcholine in increasing spike frequency adaptation. Using
integrate-and-fire simulations of an attractor network implementing memory recall
and short-term memory, it is shown that all these changes associated with aging
reduce the firing rates of the excitatory neurons, which in turn reduce the depth
of the basins of attraction, resulting in a much decreased probability in
maintaining in short-term memory what has been recalled from the attractor
network. This stochastic dynamics approach opens up new ways to understand and
potentially treat the effects of normal aging on memory and cognitive functions.

The mechanisms responsible for the integration of sensory information from
different modalities have become a topic of intense interest in psychophysics and
neuroscience. Many authors now claim that early, sensory-based cross-modal
convergence improves performance in detection tasks. An important strand of
supporting evidence for this claim is based on statistical models such as the
Pythagorean model or the probabilistic summation model. These models establish
statistical benchmarks representing the best predicted performance under the
assumption that there are no interactions between the two sensory paths.
Following this logic, when observed detection performances surpass the
predictions of these models, it is often inferred that such improvement indicates
cross-modal convergence. We present a theoretical analyses scrutinizing some of
these models and the statistical criteria most frequently used to infer early
cross-modal interactions during detection tasks. Our current analysis shows how
some common misinterpretations of these models lead to their inadequate use and, 
in turn, to contradictory results and misleading conclusions. To further
illustrate the latter point, we introduce a model that accounts for detection
performances in multimodal detection tasks but for which surpassing of the
Pythagorean or probabilistic summation benchmark can be explained without
resorting to early cross-modal interactions. Finally, we report three experiments
that put our theoretical interpretation to the test and further propose how to
adequately measure multimodal interactions in audiotactile detection tasks.

The study of human brain networks with in vivo neuroimaging has given rise to the
field of connectomics, furthered by advances in network science and graph theory 
informing our understanding of the topology and function of the healthy brain.
Here our focus is on the disruption in neuropsychiatric disorders
(pathoconnectomics) and how whole-brain computational models can help generate
and predict the dynamical interactions and consequences of brain networks over
many timescales. We review methods and emerging results that exhibit remarkable
accuracy in mapping and predicting both spontaneous and task-based healthy
network dynamics. This raises great expectations that whole-brain modeling and
computational connectomics may provide an entry point for understanding brain
disorders at a causal mechanistic level, and that computational neuropsychiatry
can ultimately be leveraged to provide novel, more effective therapeutic
interventions, e.g., through drug discovery and new targets for deep brain
stimulation.

Functional connectivity (FC) sheds light on the interactions between different
brain regions. Besides basic research, it is clinically relevant for applications
in Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, presurgical planning, epilepsy, and
traumatic brain injury. Simulations of whole-brain mean-field computational
models with realistic connectivity determined by tractography studies enable us
to reproduce with accuracy aspects of average FC in the resting state. Most
computational studies, however, did not address the prominent non-stationarity in
resting state FC, which may result in large intra- and inter-subject variability 
and thus preclude an accurate individual predictability. Here we show that this
non-stationarity reveals a rich structure, characterized by rapid transitions
switching between a few discrete FC states. We also show that computational
models optimized to fit time-averaged FC do not reproduce these spontaneous state
transitions and, thus, are not qualitatively superior to simplified linear
stochastic models, which account for the effects of structure alone. We then
demonstrate that a slight enhancement of the non-linearity of the network nodes
is sufficient to broaden the repertoire of possible network behaviors, leading to
modes of fluctuations, reminiscent of some of the most frequently observed
Resting State Networks. Because of the noise-driven exploration of this
repertoire, the dynamics of FC qualitatively change now and display
non-stationary switching similar to empirical resting state recordings
(Functional Connectivity Dynamics (FCD)). Thus FCD bear promise to serve as a

Neural principles that provide a foundation for memory, perception, and
decision-making include place coding with sparse distributed representations,
associative synaptic modification, and attractor networks in which the storage
capacity is in the order of the number of associatively modifiable recurrent
synapses on any one neuron. Based on those and further principles of cortical
computation, hypotheses are explored in which syntax is encoded in the cortex
using sparse distributed place coding. Each cortical module 2-3 mm in diameter is
proposed to be formed of a local attractor neuronal network with a capacity in
the order of 10,000 words (e.g. subjects, verbs or objects depending on the
module). Such a system may form a deep language-of-thought layer. For the
information to be communicated to other people, the modules in which the neurons 
are firing which encode the syntactic role, as well as which neurons are firing
to specify the words, must be communicated. It is proposed that one solution to
this (used in English) is temporal order encoding, for example
subject-verb-object. It is shown with integrate-and-fire simulations that this
order encoding could be implemented by weakly forward-coupled subject-verb-object
modules. A related system can decode a temporal sequence. This approach based on 
known principles of cortical computation needs to be extended to investigate
further whether it could form a biological foundation for the implementation of
language in the brain. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Brain
and Memory.

The most salient feature of spontaneous human brain activity as recorded with
electroencephalography (EEG) are rhythmic fluctuations around 10Hz. These alpha
oscillations have been reported to propagate over the scalp with velocities in
the range of 5-15m/s. Since these velocities are in the range of action potential
velocities through cortico-cortical axons, it has been hypothesized that the
observed scalp waves reflect cortico-cortically mediated propagation of cortical 
oscillations. The reported scalp velocities however, appear to be inconsistent
with those estimated from local field potential recordings in dogs, which are
<1m/s and agree with the propagation velocity of action potentials in
intra-cortical axons. In this study, we resolve these diverging findings using a 
combination of EEG data-analysis and biophysical modeling. In particular, we
demonstrate that the observed scalp velocities can be accounted for by slow
traveling oscillations, which provides support for the claim that spatial
propagation of alpha oscillations is mediated by intra-cortical axons.

Using the virtual brain to reveal the role of oscillations and plasticity in
shaping brain's dynamical landscape.

Spontaneous brain activity, that is, activity in the absence of controlled
stimulus input or an explicit active task, is topologically organized in multiple
functional networks (FNs) maintaining a high degree of coherence. These "resting 
state networks" are constrained by the underlying anatomical connectivity between
brain areas. They are also influenced by the history of task-related activation. 
The precise rules that link plastic changes and ongoing dynamics of resting-state
functional connectivity (rs-FC) remain unclear. Using the framework of the open
source neuroinformatics platform "The Virtual Brain," we identify potential
computational mechanisms that alter the dynamical landscape, leading to
reconfigurations of FNs. Using a spiking neuron model, we first demonstrate that 
network activity in the absence of plasticity is characterized by irregular
oscillations between low-amplitude asynchronous states and high-amplitude
synchronous states. We then demonstrate the capability of spike-timing-dependent 
plasticity (STDP) combined with intrinsic alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations to
efficiently influence learning. Further, we show how alpha-state-dependent STDP
alters the local area dynamics from an irregular to a highly periodic alpha-like 
state. This is an important finding, as the cortical input from the thalamus is
at the rate of alpha. We demonstrate how resulting rhythmic cortical output in
this frequency range acts as a neuronal tuner and, hence, leads to
synchronization or de-synchronization between brain areas. Finally, we
demonstrate that locally restricted structural connectivity changes influence
local as well as global dynamics and lead to altered rs-FC.

The discrepancy between structural and functional connectivity in neural systems 
forms the challenge in understanding general brain functioning. To pinpoint a
mapping between structure and function, we investigated the effects of
(in)homogeneity in coupling structure and delays on synchronization behavior in
networks of oscillatory neural masses by deriving the phase dynamics of these
generic networks. For homogeneous delays, the structural coupling matrix is
largely preserved in the coupling between phases, resulting in clustered
stationary phase distributions. Accordingly, we found only a small number of
synchronized groups in the network. Distributed delays, by contrast, introduce
inhomogeneity in the phase coupling so that clustered stationary phase
distributions no longer exist. The effect of distributed delays mimicked that of 
structural inhomogeneity. Hence, we argue that phase (de-)synchronization
patterns caused by inhomogeneous coupling cannot be distinguished from those
caused by distributed delays, at least not by the naked eye. The here-derived
analytical expression for the effective coupling between phases as a function of 
structural coupling constitutes a direct relationship between structural and
functional connectivity. Structural connectivity constrains synchronizability
that may be modified by the delay distribution. This explains why structural and 
functional connectivity bear much resemblance albeit not a one-to-one
correspondence. We illustrate this in the context of resting-state activity,
using the anatomical connectivity structure reported by Hagmann and others.

The complex network dynamics that arise from the interaction of the brain's
structural and functional architectures give rise to mental function. Theoretical
models demonstrate that the structure-function relation is maximal when the
global network dynamics operate at a critical point of state transition. In the
present work, we used a dynamic mean-field neural model to fit empirical
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) data acquired in
humans and macaques and developed a new iterative-fitting algorithm to optimize
the SC matrix based on the FC matrix. A dramatic improvement of the fitting of
the matrices was obtained with the addition of a small number of anatomical
links, particularly cross-hemispheric connections, and reweighting of existing
connections. We suggest that the notion of a critical working point, where the
structure-function interplay is maximal, may provide a new way to link behavior
and cognition, and a new perspective to understand recovery of function in
clinical conditions.

The spontaneous activity of the brain shows different features at different
scales. On one hand, neuroimaging studies show that long-range correlations are
highly structured in spatiotemporal patterns, known as resting-state networks, on
the other hand, neurophysiological reports show that short-range correlations
between neighboring neurons are low, despite a large amount of shared presynaptic
inputs. Different dynamical mechanisms of local decorrelation have been proposed,
among which is feedback inhibition. Here, we investigated the effect of locally
regulating the feedback inhibition on the global dynamics of a large-scale brain 
model, in which the long-range connections are given by diffusion imaging data of
human subjects. We used simulations and analytical methods to show that locally
constraining the feedback inhibition to compensate for the excess of long-range
excitatory connectivity, to preserve the asynchronous state, crucially changes
the characteristics of the emergent resting and evoked activity. First, it
significantly improves the model's prediction of the empirical human functional
connectivity. Second, relaxing this constraint leads to an unrealistic network
evoked activity, with systematic coactivation of cortical areas which are
components of the default-mode network, whereas regulation of feedback inhibition
prevents this. Finally, information theoretic analysis shows that regulation of
the local feedback inhibition increases both the entropy and the Fisher
information of the network evoked responses. Hence, it enhances the information
capacity and the discrimination accuracy of the global network. In conclusion,
the local excitation-inhibition ratio impacts the structure of the spontaneous
activity and the information transmission at the large-scale brain level.

In principle, cortico-cortical communication dynamics is simple: neurons in one
cortical area communicate by sending action potentials that release glutamate and
excite their target neurons in other cortical areas. In practice, knowledge about
cortico-cortical communication dynamics is minute. One reason is that no current 
technique can capture the fast spatio-temporal cortico-cortical evolution of
action potential transmission and membrane conductances with sufficient spatial
resolution. A combination of optogenetics and monosynaptic tracing with virus can
reveal the spatio-temporal cortico-cortical dynamics of specific neurons and
their targets, but does not reveal how the dynamics evolves under natural
conditions. Spontaneous ongoing action potentials also spread across cortical
areas and are difficult to separate from structured evoked and intrinsic brain
activity such as thinking. At a certain state of evolution, the dynamics may
engage larger populations of neurons to drive the brain to decisions, percepts
and behaviors. For example, successfully evolving dynamics to sensory transients 
can appear at the mesoscopic scale revealing how the transient is perceived. As a
consequence of these methodological and conceptual difficulties, studies in this 
field comprise a wide range of computational models, large-scale measurements
(e.g., by MEG, EEG), and a combination of invasive measurements in animal
experiments. Further obstacles and challenges of studying cortico-cortical
communication dynamics are outlined in this critical review.

Decision making is a process of utmost importance in our daily lives, the study
of which has been receiving notable attention for decades. Nevertheless, the
neural mechanisms underlying decision making are still not fully understood.
Computational modeling has revealed itself as a valuable asset to address some of
the fundamental questions. Biophysically plausible models, in particular, are
useful in bridging the different levels of description that experimental studies 
provide, from the neural spiking activity recorded at the cellular level to the
performance reported at the behavioral level. In this article, we have reviewed
some of the recent progress made in the understanding of the neural mechanisms
that underlie decision making. We have performed a critical evaluation of the
available results and address, from a computational perspective, aspects of both 
experimentation and modeling that so far have eluded comprehension. To guide the 
discussion, we have selected a central theme which revolves around the following 
question: how does the spatiotemporal structure of sensory stimuli affect the
perceptual decision-making process? This question is a timely one as several
issues that still remain unresolved stem from this central theme. These include: 
(i) the role of spatiotemporal input fluctuations in perceptual decision making, 
(ii) how to extend the current results and models derived from two-alternative
choice studies to scenarios with multiple competing evidences, and (iii) to
establish whether different types of spatiotemporal input fluctuations affect
decision-making outcomes in distinctive ways. And although we have restricted our
discussion mostly to visual decisions, our main conclusions are arguably
generalizable; hence, their possible extension to other sensory modalities is one
of the points in our discussion.

Brain function relies on the flexible integration of a diverse set of segregated 
cortical modules, with the structural connectivity of the brain being a
fundamentally important factor in shaping the brain's functional dynamics.
Following up on macroscopic studies showing the existence of centrally connected 
nodes in the mammalian brain, combined with the notion that these putative brain 
hubs may form a dense interconnected 'rich club' collective, we hypothesized that
brain connectivity might involve a rich club type of architecture to promote a
repertoire of different and flexibly accessible brain functions. With the rich
club suggested to play an important role in global brain communication, examining
the effects of a rich club organization on the functional repertoire of physical 
systems in general, and the brain in particular, is of keen interest. Here we
elucidate these effects using a spin glass model of neural networks for
simulating stable configurations of cortical activity. Using simulations, we show
that the presence of a rich club increases the set of attractors and hence the
diversity of the functional repertoire over and above the effects produced by
scale free type topology alone. Within the networks' overall functional
repertoire rich nodes are shown to be important for enabling a high level of
dynamic integrations of low-degree nodes to form functional networks. This
suggests that the rich club serves as an important backbone for numerous
co-activation patterns among peripheral nodes of the network. In addition,
applying the spin glass model to empirical anatomical data of the human brain, we
show that the positive effects on the functional repertoire attributed to the
rich club phenomenon can be observed for the brain as well. We conclude that a
rich club organization in network architectures may be crucial for the
facilitation and integration of a diverse number of segregated functions.

BACKGROUND: Positive clinical outcomes are now well established for deep brain
stimulation, but little is known about the effects of long-term deep brain
stimulation on brain structural and functional connectivity. Here, we used the
rare opportunity to acquire pre- and postoperative diffusion tensor imaging in a 
patient undergoing deep brain stimulation in bilateral subthalamic nuclei for
Parkinson's Disease. This allowed us to analyse the differences in structural
connectivity before and after deep brain stimulation. Further, a computational
model of spontaneous brain activity was used to estimate the changes in
functional connectivity arising from the specific changes in structural
connectivity.
RESULTS: We found significant localised structural changes as a result of
long-term deep brain stimulation. These changes were found in sensory-motor,
prefrontal/limbic, and olfactory brain regions which are known to be affected in 
Parkinson's Disease. The nature of these changes was an increase of nodal
efficiency in most areas and a decrease of nodal efficiency in the precentral
sensory-motor area. Importantly, the computational model clearly shows the impact
of deep brain stimulation-induced structural alterations on functional brain
changes, which is to shift the neural dynamics back towards a healthy regime. The
results demonstrate that deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's Disease leads to a
topological reorganisation towards healthy bifurcation of the functional networks
measured in controls, which suggests a potential neural mechanism for the
alleviation of symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that long-term deep brain stimulation has not
only restorative effects on the structural connectivity, but also affects the
functional connectivity at a global level. Overall, our results support causal
changes in human neural plasticity after long-term deep brain stimulation and may
help to identify the underlying mechanisms of deep brain stimulation.

Since the mid 1990s, the intriguing dynamics of the brain at rest has been
attracting a growing body of research in neuroscience. Neuroimaging studies have 
revealed distinct functional networks that slowly activate and deactivate,
pointing to the existence of an underlying network dynamics emerging
spontaneously during rest, with specific spatial, temporal and spectral
characteristics. Several theoretical scenarios have been proposed and tested with
the use of large-scale computational models of coupled brain areas. However, a
mechanistic explanation that encompasses all the phenomena observed in the brain 
during rest is still to come. In this review, we provide an overview of the key
findings of resting-state activity covering a range of neuroimaging modalities
including fMRI, EEG and MEG. We describe how to best define and analyze
anatomical and functional brain networks and how unbalancing these networks may
lead to problems with mental health. Finally, we review existing large-scale
models of resting-state dynamics in health and disease. An important common
feature of resting-state models is that the emergence of resting-state functional
networks is obtained when the model parameters are such that the system operates 
at the edge of a bifurcation. At this critical working point, the global network 
dynamics reveals correlation patterns that are spatially shaped by the underlying
anatomical structure, leading to an optimal fit with the empirical BOLD
functional connectivity. However, new insights coming from recent studies,
including faster oscillatory dynamics and non-stationary functional connectivity,
must be taken into account in future models to fully understand the network
mechanisms leading to the resting-state activity.

The neuropathology of schizophrenia remains unclear. Some insight has come from
modern neuroimaging techniques, which offer an unparalleled opportunity to
explore in vivo the structure and function of the brain. Using functional
magnetic resonance imaging, it has been found that the large-scale resting-state 
functional connectivity (rsFC) in schizophrenia--measured as the temporal
correlations of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal--exhibit altered
network topology, with lower small-world index. The origin of these rsFC
alterations and link with the underlying structural connectivity remain unclear. 
In this work, we used a computational model of spontaneous large-scale brain
activity to explore the role of the structural connectivity in the large-scale
dynamics of the brain in health and schizophrenia. The structural connectomes
from 15 adolescent patients with early-onset schizophrenia and 15 age- and
gender-matched controls were built from diffusion tensor imaging data to detect
the white matter tracts between 90 brain areas. Brain areas, simulated using a
reduced dynamic mean-field model, receive excitatory input from other areas in
proportion to the number of fibre tracts between them. The simulated mean field
activity was transformed into BOLD signal, and the properties of the simulated
functional networks were analyzed. Our results suggest that the functional
alterations observed in schizophrenia are not directly linked to alterations in
the structural topology. Instead, subtly randomized and less small-world
functional networks appear when the brain operates with lower global coupling,
which shifts the dynamics from the optimal healthy regime.

We are concerned with the complexity reduction of a stochastic system of
differential equations governing the dynamics of a neuronal circuit describing a 
decision-making task. This reduction is based on the slow-fast behavior of the
problem and holds on the whole phase space and not only locally around the
spontaneous state. Macroscopic quantities, such as performance and reaction
times, computed applying this reduction are in agreement with previous works in
which the complexity reduction is locally performed at the spontaneous point by
means of a Taylor expansion.

Spontaneous (or resting-state) brain activity has attracted a growing body of
neuroimaging research over the last decades. Whole-brain network models have
proved helpful to investigate the source of slow (<0.1 Hz) correlated hemodynamic
fluctuations revealed in fMRI during rest. However, the mechanisms mediating
resting-state long-distance correlations and the relationship with the faster
neural activity remain unclear. Novel insights coming from MEG studies have shown
that the amplitude envelopes of alpha- and beta-frequency oscillations (~8-30 Hz)
display similar correlation patterns as the fMRI signals. In this work, we
combine experimental and theoretical work to investigate the mechanisms of
spontaneous MEG functional connectivity. Using a simple model of coupled
oscillators adapted to incorporate realistic whole-brain connectivity and
conduction delays, we explore how slow and structured amplitude envelopes of
band-pass filtered signals - fairly reproducing MEG data collected from 10
healthy subjects at rest - are generated spontaneously in the space-time
structure of the brain network. Our simulation results show that the large-scale 
neuroanatomical connectivity provides an optimal network structure to support a
regime with metastable synchronization. In this regime, different subsystems may 
temporarily synchronize at reduced collective frequencies (falling in the 8-30 Hz
range due to the delays) while the global system never fully synchronizes. This
mechanism modulates the frequency of the oscillators on a slow time-scale (<0.1
Hz) leading to structured amplitude fluctuations of band-pass filtered signals.
Taken overall, our results reveal that the structured amplitude envelope
fluctuations observed in resting-state MEG data may originate from spontaneous
synchronization mechanisms naturally occurring in the space-time structure of the
brain.

In recent years the study of the intrinsic brain dynamics in a relaxed awake
state in the absence of any specific task has gained increasing attention, as
spontaneous neural activity has been found to be highly structured at a large
scale. This so called resting-state activity has been found to be comprised by
nonrandom spatiotemporal patterns and fluctuations, and several Resting-State
Networks (RSN) have been found in BOLD-fMRI as well as in MEG signal power
envelope correlations. The underlying anatomical connectivity structure between
areas of the brain has been identified as being a key to the observed functional 
network connectivity, but the mechanisms behind this are still underdetermined.
Theoretical large-scale brain models for fMRI data have corroborated the
importance of the connectome in shaping network dynamics, while the importance of
delays and noise differ between studies and depend on the models' specific
dynamics. In the current study, we present a spiking neuron network model that is
able to produce noisy, distributed alpha-oscillations, matching the power peak in
the spectrum of group resting-state MEG recordings. We studied how well the model
captured the inter-node correlation structure of the alpha-band power envelopes
for different delays between brain areas, and found that the model performs best 
for propagation delays inside the physiological range (5-10 m/s). Delays also
shift the transition from noisy to bursting oscillations to higher global
coupling values in the model. Thus, in contrast to the asynchronous fMRI state,
delays are important to consider in the presence of oscillation.

In the brain, synchronization among cells of an assembly is a common phenomenon, 
and thought to be functionally relevant. Here we used an in vitro experimental
model of cell assemblies, cortical cultures, combined with numerical simulations 
of a spiking neural network (SNN) to investigate how and why spontaneous
synchronization occurs. In order to deal with excitation only, we
pharmacologically blocked GABAAergic transmission using bicuculline. Synchronous 
events in cortical cultures tend to involve almost every cell and to display
relatively constant durations. We have thus named these "network spikes" (NS).
The inter-NS-intervals (INSIs) proved to be a more interesting phenomenon. In
most cortical cultures NSs typically come in series or bursts ("bursts of NSs",
BNS), with short (~1 s) INSIs and separated by long silent intervals (tens of s),
which leads to bimodal INSI distributions. This suggests that a facilitating
mechanism is at work, presumably short-term synaptic facilitation, as well as two
fatigue mechanisms: one with a short timescale, presumably short-term synaptic
depression, and another one with a longer timescale, presumably cellular
adaptation. We thus incorporated these three mechanisms into the SNN, which,
indeed, produced realistic BNSs. Next, we systematically varied the recurrent
excitation for various adaptation timescales. Strong excitability led to
frequent, quasi-periodic BNSs (CV~0), and weak excitability led to rare BNSs,
approaching a Poisson process (CV~1). Experimental cultures appear to operate
within an intermediate weakly-synchronized regime (CV~0.5), with an adaptation
timescale in the 2-8 s range, and well described by a
Poisson-with-refractory-period model. Taken together, our results demonstrate
that the INSI statistics are indeed informative: they allowed us to infer the
mechanisms at work, and many parameters that we cannot access experimentally.

Coherent delta-band oscillations between cortical areas correlate with decision
making.

de México, 04510 Mexico D.F., Mexico.

Coherent oscillations in the theta-to-gamma frequency range have been proposed as
a mechanism that coordinates neural activity in large-scale cortical networks in 
sensory, motor, and cognitive tasks. Whether this mechanism also involves
coherent oscillations at delta frequencies (1-4 Hz) is not known. Rather, delta
oscillations have been associated with slow-wave sleep. Here, we show coherent
oscillations in the delta frequency band between parietal and frontal cortices
during the decision-making component of a somatosensory discrimination task.
Importantly, the magnitude of this delta-band coherence is modulated by the
different decision alternatives. Furthermore, during control conditions not
requiring decision making, delta-band coherences are typically much reduced. Our 
work indicates an important role for synchronous activity in the delta frequency 
band when large-scale, distant cortical networks coordinate their neural activity
during decision making.

So far, it was unclear if social hierarchy could influence sensory or perceptual 
cognitive processes. We evaluated the effects of social hierarchy on these
processes using a basic visual perceptual decision task. We constructed a social 
hierarchy where participants performed the perceptual task separately with two
covertly simulated players (superior, inferior). Participants were faster
(better) when performing the discrimination task with the superior player. We
studied the time course when social hierarchy was processed using event-related
potentials and observed hierarchical effects even in early stages of
sensory-perceptual processing, suggesting early top-down modulation by social
hierarchy. Moreover, in a parallel analysis, we fitted a drift-diffusion model
(DDM) to the results to evaluate the decision making process of this perceptual
task in the context of a social hierarchy. Consistently, the DDM pointed to
nondecision time (probably perceptual encoding) as the principal period
influenced by social hierarchy.

Population codes assume that neural systems represent sensory inputs through the 
firing rates of populations of differently tuned neurons. However, trial-by-trial
variability and noise correlations are known to affect the information capacity
of neural codes. Although recent studies have shown that stimulus presentation
reduces both variability and rate correlations with respect to their spontaneous 
level, possibly improving the encoding accuracy, whether these second order
statistics are tuned is unknown. If so, second-order statistics could themselves 
carry information, rather than being invariably detrimental. Here we show that
rate variability and noise correlation vary systematically with stimulus
direction in directionally selective middle temporal (MT) neurons, leading to
characteristic tuning curves. We show that such tuning emerges in a stochastic
recurrent network, for a set of connectivity parameters that overlaps with a
single-state scenario and multistability. Information theoretic analysis shows
that second-order statistics carry information that can improve the accuracy of
the population code.

The transition from wakefulness to sleep represents the most conspicuous change
in behavior and the level of consciousness occurring in the healthy brain. It is 
accompanied by similarly conspicuous changes in neural dynamics, traditionally
exemplified by the change from "desynchronized" electroencephalogram activity in 
wake to globally synchronized slow wave activity of early sleep. However, unit
and local field recordings indicate that the transition is more gradual than it
might appear: On one hand, local slow waves already appear during wake; on the
other hand, slow sleep waves are only rarely global. Studies with functional
magnetic resonance imaging also reveal changes in resting-state functional
connectivity (FC) between wake and slow wave sleep. However, it remains unclear
how resting-state networks may change during this transition period. Here, we
employ large-scale modeling of the human cortico-cortical anatomical connectivity
to evaluate changes in resting-state FC when the model "falls asleep" due to the 
progressive decrease in arousal-promoting neuromodulation. When cholinergic
neuromodulation is parametrically decreased, local slow waves appear, while the
overall organization of resting-state networks does not change. Furthermore, we
show that these local slow waves are structured macroscopically in networks that 
resemble the resting-state networks. In contrast, when the neuromodulator
decrease further to very low levels, slow waves become global and resting-state
networks merge into a single undifferentiated, broadly synchronized network.

Resting-state functional connectivity emerges from structurally and dynamically
shaped slow linear fluctuations.

Brain fluctuations at rest are not random but are structured in spatial patterns 
of correlated activity across different brain areas. The question of how
resting-state functional connectivity (FC) emerges from the brain's anatomical
connections has motivated several experimental and computational studies to
understand structure-function relationships. However, the mechanistic origin of
resting state is obscured by large-scale models' complexity, and a close
structure-function relation is still an open problem. Thus, a realistic but
simple enough description of relevant brain dynamics is needed. Here, we derived 
a dynamic mean field model that consistently summarizes the realistic dynamics of
a detailed spiking and conductance-based synaptic large-scale network, in which
connectivity is constrained by diffusion imaging data from human subjects. The
dynamic mean field approximates the ensemble dynamics, whose temporal evolution
is dominated by the longest time scale of the system. With this reduction, we
demonstrated that FC emerges as structured linear fluctuations around a stable
low firing activity state close to destabilization. Moreover, the model can be
further and crucially simplified into a set of motion equations for statistical
moments, providing a direct analytical link between anatomical structure, neural 
network dynamics, and FC. Our study suggests that FC arises from noise
propagation and dynamical slowing down of fluctuations in an anatomically
constrained dynamical system. Altogether, the reduction from spiking models to
statistical moments presented here provides a new framework to explicitly
understand the building up of FC through neuronal dynamics underpinned by
anatomical connections and to drive hypotheses in task-evoked studies and for
clinical applications.

Comment in
    J Neurosci. 2013 Sep 25;33(39):15321-3.

Can learning capacity of the human brain be predicted from initial spontaneous
functional connectivity (FC) between brain areas involved in a task? We combined 
task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting-state fMRI 
(rs-fMRI) before and after training with a Hindi dental-retroflex nonnative
contrast. Previous fMRI results were replicated, demonstrating that this learning
recruited the left insula/frontal operculum and the left superior parietal lobe, 
among other areas of the brain. Crucially, resting-state FC (rs-FC) between these
two areas at pretraining predicted individual differences in learning outcomes
after distributed (Experiment 1) and intensive training (Experiment 2).
Furthermore, this rs-FC was reduced at posttraining, a change that may also
account for learning. Finally, resting-state network analyses showed that the
mechanism underlying this reduction of rs-FC was mainly a transfer in intrinsic
activity of the left frontal operculum/anterior insula from the left
frontoparietal network to the salience network. Thus, rs-FC may contribute to
predict learning ability and to understand how learning modifies the functioning 
of the brain. The discovery of this correspondence between initial spontaneous
brain activity in task-related areas and posttraining performance opens new
avenues to find predictors of learning capacities in the brain using task-related
fMRI and rs-fMRI combined.

With the increasing availability of advanced imaging technologies, we are
entering a new era of neuroscience. Detailed descriptions of the complex brain
network enable us to map out a structural connectome, characterize it with graph 
theoretical methods, and compare it to the functional networks with increasing
detail. To link these two aspects and understand how dynamics and structure
interact to form functional brain networks in task and in the resting state, we
use theoretical models. The advantage of using theoretical models is that by
recreating functional connectivity and time series explicitly from structure and 
pre-defined dynamics, we can extract critical mechanisms by linking structure and
function in ways not directly accessible in the real brain. Recently,
resting-state models with varying local dynamics have reproduced empirical
functional connectivity patterns, and given support to the view that the brain
works at a critical point at the edge of a bifurcation of the system. Here, we
present an overview of a modeling approach of the resting brain network and give 
an application of a neural mass model in the study of complexity changes in
aging.

In the study of decision making, emphasis is placed on different forms of
perceptual integration, while the influence of other factors, such as memory, is 
ignored. In addition, it is believed that the information underlying decision
making is carried in the rate of the neuronal response, while its variability is 
considered unspecific. Here we studied the influence of recent experience on
motor decision making by analyzing the activity of neurons in the dorsal premotor
area of two monkeys performing a countermanding arm task. We observe that the
across-trial variability of the neural response strongly correlates with trial
history-dependent changes in reaction time. Using a theoretical model of decision
making, we show that a trial history-monitoring signal can explain the observed
behavioral and neural modulation. Our study reveals that, in the neural processes
that culminate in motor plan maturation, the evidence provided by perception and 
memory is reflected in mean rate and variance respectively.

Holding multiple items in short term memory: a neural mechanism.

Rolls ET(1), Dempere-Marco L, Deco G.

Human short term memory has a capacity of several items maintained
simultaneously. We show how the number of short term memory representations that 
an attractor network modeling a cortical local network can simultaneously
maintain active is increased by using synaptic facilitation of the type found in 
the prefrontal cortex. We have been able to maintain 9 short term memories active
simultaneously in integrate-and-fire simulations where the proportion of neurons 
in each population, the sparseness, is 0.1, and have confirmed the stability of
such a system with mean field analyses. Without synaptic facilitation the system 
can maintain many fewer memories active in the same network. The system operates 
because of the effectively increased synaptic strengths formed by the synaptic
facilitation just for those pools to which the cue is applied, and then
maintenance of this synaptic facilitation in just those pools when the cue is
removed by the continuing neuronal firing in those pools. The findings have
implications for understanding how several items can be maintained simultaneously
in short term memory, how this may be relevant to the implementation of language 
in the brain, and suggest new approaches to understanding and treating the
decline in short term memory that can occur with normal aging.

Resting-state networks (RSNs), which have become a main focus in neuroimaging
research, can be best simulated by large-scale cortical models in which networks 
teeter on the edge of instability. In this state, the functional networks are in 
a low firing stable state while they are continuously pulled towards multiple
other configurations. Small extrinsic perturbations can shape task-related
network dynamics, whereas perturbations from intrinsic noise generate excursions 
reflecting the range of available functional networks. This is particularly
advantageous for the efficiency and speed of network mobilization. Thus, the
resting state reflects the dynamical capabilities of the brain, which emphasizes 
the vital interplay of time and space. In this article, we propose a new
theoretical framework for RSNs that can serve as a fertile ground for empirical
testing.

We report that multi-stable perception operates in a consistent, dynamical
regime, balancing the conflicting goals of stability and sensitivity. When a
multi-stable visual display is viewed continuously, its phenomenal appearance
reverses spontaneously at irregular intervals. We characterized the perceptual
dynamics of individual observers in terms of four statistical measures: the
distribution of dominance times (mean and variance) and the novel, subtle
dependence on prior history (correlation and time-constant). The dynamics of
multi-stable perception is known to reflect several stabilizing and destabilizing
factors. Phenomenologically, its main aspects are captured by a simplistic
computational model with competition, adaptation, and noise. We identified small 
parameter volumes (~3% of the possible volume) in which the model reproduced both
dominance distribution and history-dependence of each observer. For 21 of 24 data
sets, the identified volumes clustered tightly (~15% of the possible volume),
revealing a consistent "operating regime" of multi-stable perception. The
"operating regime" turned out to be marginally stable or, equivalently, near the 
brink of an oscillatory instability. The chance probability of the observed
clustering was <0.02. To understand the functional significance of this empirical
"operating regime," we compared it to the theoretical "sweet spot" of the model. 
We computed this "sweet spot" as the intersection of the parameter volumes in
which the model produced stable perceptual outcomes and in which it was sensitive
to input modulations. Remarkably, the empirical "operating regime" proved to be
largely coextensive with the theoretical "sweet spot." This demonstrated that
perceptual dynamics was not merely consistent but also functionally optimized (in
that it balances stability with sensitivity). Our results imply that multi-stable
perception is not a laboratory curiosity, but reflects a functional optimization 
of perceptual dynamics for visual inference.

The neural correlates of conscious visual perception are commonly studied in
paradigms of perceptual multistability that allow multiple perceptual
interpretations during unchanged sensory stimulation. What is the source of this 
multistability in the content of perception? From a theoretical perspective, a
fine balance between deterministic and stochastic forces has been suggested to
underlie the spontaneous, intrinsically driven perceptual transitions observed
during multistable perception. Deterministic forces are represented by adaptation
of feature-selective neuronal populations encoding the competing percepts while
stochastic forces are modeled as noise-driven processes. Here, we used a unified 
neuronal competition model to study the dynamics of adaptation and noise
processes in binocular flash suppression (BFS), a form of externally induced
perceptual suppression, and compare it with the dynamics of intrinsically driven 
alternations in binocular rivalry (BR). For the first time, we use
electrophysiological, biologically relevant data to constrain a model of
perceptual rivalry. Specifically, we show that the mean population discharge
pattern of a perceptually modulated neuronal population detected in
electrophysiological recordings in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) during
BFS, constrains the dynamical range of externally induced perceptual transitions 
to a region around the bifurcation separating a noise-driven attractor regime
from an adaptation-driven oscillatory regime. Most interestingly, the dynamical
range of intrinsically driven perceptual transitions during BR is located in the 
noise-driven attractor regime, where it overlaps with BFS. Our results suggest
that the neurodynamical mechanisms of externally induced and spontaneously
generated perceptual alternations overlap in a narrow, noise-driven region just
before a bifurcation where the system becomes adaptation-driven.

Modeling work in neuroscience can be classified using two different criteria. The
first one is the complexity of the model, ranging from simplified conceptual
models that are amenable to mathematical analysis to detailed models that require
simulations in order to understand their properties. The second criterion is that
of direction of workflow, which can be from microscopic to macroscopic scales
(bottom-up) or from behavioral target functions to properties of components
(top-down). We review the interaction of theory and simulation using examples of 
top-down and bottom-up studies and point to some current developments in the
fields of computational and theoretical neuroscience.

Resting state networks (RSNs) show a surprisingly coherent and robust
spatiotemporal organization. Previous theoretical studies demonstrated that these
patterns can be understood as emergent on the basis of the underlying
neuroanatomical connectivity skeleton. Integrating the biologically realistic
DTI/DSI-(Diffusion Tensor Imaging/Diffusion Spectrum Imaging)based
neuroanatomical connectivity into a brain model of Ising spin dynamics, we found 
a system with multiple attractors, which can be studied analytically. The
multistable attractor landscape thus defines a functionally meaningful dynamic
repertoire of the brain network that is inherently present in the neuroanatomical
connectivity. We demonstrate that the more entropy of attractors exists, the
richer is the dynamical repertoire and consequently the brain network displays
more capabilities of computation. We hypothesize therefore that human brain
connectivity developed a scale free type of architecture in order to be able to
store a large number of different and flexibly accessible brain functions.

Synaptic depression and slow oscillatory activity in a biophysical network model 
of the cerebral cortex.

Catalunya Barcelona, Spain.

Short-term synaptic depression (STD) is a form of synaptic plasticity that has a 
large impact on network computations. Experimental results suggest that STD is
modulated by cortical activity, decreasing with activity in the network and
increasing during silent states. Here, we explored different activity-modulation 
protocols in a biophysical network model for which the model displayed less STD
when the network was active than when it was silent, in agreement with
experimental results. Furthermore, we studied how trains of synaptic potentials
had lesser decay during periods of activity (UP states) than during silent
periods (DOWN states), providing new experimental predictions. We next tackled
the inverse question of what is the impact of modifying STD parameters on the
emergent activity of the network, a question difficult to answer experimentally. 
We found that synaptic depression of cortical connections had a critical role to 
determine the regime of rhythmic cortical activity. While low STD resulted in an 
emergent rhythmic activity with short UP states and long DOWN states, increasing 
STD resulted in longer and more frequent UP states interleaved with short silent 
periods. A still higher synaptic depression set the network into a
non-oscillatory firing regime where DOWN states no longer occurred. The speed of 
propagation of UP states along the network was not found to be modulated by STD
during the oscillatory regime; it remained relatively stable over a range of
values of STD. Overall, we found that the mutual interactions between synaptic
depression and ongoing network activity are critical to determine the mechanisms 
that modulate cortical emergent patterns.

Learning selective top-down control enhances performance in a visual
categorization task.

We model the putative neuronal and synaptic mechanisms involved in learning a
visual categorization task, taking inspiration from single-cell recordings in
inferior temporal cortex (ITC). Our working hypothesis is that learning the
categorization task involves both bottom-up, ITC to prefrontal cortex (PFC), and 
top-down (PFC to ITC) synaptic plasticity and that the latter enhances the
selectivity of the ITC neurons encoding the task-relevant features of the
stimuli, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio. We test this hypothesis by 
modeling both areas and their connections with spiking neurons and plastic
synapses, ITC acting as a feature-selective layer and PFC as a category coding
layer. This minimal model gives interesting clues as to properties and function
of the selective feedback signal from PFC to ITC that help solving a
categorization task. In particular, we show that, when the stimuli are very noisy
because of a large number of nonrelevant features, the feedback structure helps
getting better categorization performance and decreasing the reaction time. It
also affects the speed and stability of the learning process and sharpens tuning 
curves of ITC neurons. Furthermore, the model predicts a modulation of neural
activities during error trials, by which the differential selectivity of ITC
neurons to task-relevant and task-irrelevant features diminishes or is even
reversed, and modulations in the time course of neural activities that appear
when, after learning, corrupted versions of the stimuli are input to the network.

The study of working memory capacity is of outmost importance in cognitive
psychology as working memory is at the basis of general cognitive function.
Although the working memory capacity limit has been thoroughly studied, its
origin still remains a matter of strong debate. Only recently has the role of
visual saliency in modulating working memory storage capacity been assessed
experimentally and proved to provide valuable insights into working memory
function. In the computational arena, attractor networks have successfully
accounted for psychophysical and neurophysiological data in numerous working
memory tasks given their ability to produce a sustained elevated firing rate
during a delay period. Here we investigate the mechanisms underlying working
memory capacity by means of a biophysically-realistic attractor network with
spiking neurons while accounting for two recent experimental observations: 1) the
presence of a visually salient item reduces the number of items that can be held 
in working memory, and 2) visually salient items are commonly kept in memory at
the cost of not keeping as many non-salient items. Our model suggests that
working memory capacity is determined by two fundamental processes: encoding of
visual items into working memory and maintenance of the encoded items upon their 
removal from the visual display. While maintenance critically depends on the
constraints that lateral inhibition imposes to the mnemonic activity, encoding is
limited by the ability of the stimulated neural assemblies to reach a
sufficiently high level of excitation, a process governed by the dynamics of
competition and cooperation among neuronal pools. Encoding is therefore
contingent upon the visual working memory task and has led us to introduce the
concept of effective working memory capacity (eWMC) in contrast to the maximal
upper capacity limit only reached under ideal conditions.

Fabra, Barcelona, Spain. albantakis@wisc.edu

The role of changes of mind and multiple choices has recently received increased 
attention in the study of perceptual decision-making. Previously, these
extensions to standard two-alternative tasks have been studied separately. Here
we explored how changes of mind depend on the number of choice-alternatives. To
this end, we tested 14 human subjects on a 2- and 4-alternative
direction-discrimination task. Changes of mind in the participants' movement
trajectories could be observed for two and for four choice alternatives. With
fewer alternatives, participants responded faster and more accurately. The
frequency of changes of mind, however, did not significantly differ for the
different numbers of choice alternatives. Nevertheless, mind-changing improved
the participants' final performance, particularly for intermediate difficulty
levels, in both experimental conditions. Moreover, the mean reaction times of
individual participants were negatively correlated with their overall tendency to
make changes of mind. We further reproduced these findings with a
multi-alternative attractor model for decision-making, while a simple race model 
could not account for the experimental data. Our experiment, combined with the
theoretical models allowed us to shed light on: (1) the differences in choice
behavior between two and four alternatives, (2) the differences between the data 
of our human subjects and previous monkey data, (3) individual differences
between participants, and (4) the inhibitory interaction between neural
representations of choice alternatives.

Perception and self-organized instability.

Friston K(1), Breakspear M, Deco G.

Author information: 
(1)The Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London London, 
UK.

This paper considers state-dependent dynamics that mediate perception in the
brain. In particular, it considers the formal basis of self-organized
instabilities that enable perceptual transitions during Bayes-optimal perception.
The basic phenomena we consider are perceptual transitions that lead to conscious
ignition (Dehaene and Changeux, 2011) and how they depend on dynamical
instabilities that underlie chaotic itinerancy (Breakspear, 2001; Tsuda, 2001)
and self-organized criticality (Beggs and Plenz, 2003; Plenz and Thiagarajan,
2007; Shew et al., 2011). Our approach is based on a dynamical formulation of
perception as approximate Bayesian inference, in terms of variational free energy
minimization. This formulation suggests that perception has an inherent tendency 
to induce dynamical instabilities (critical slowing) that enable the brain to
respond sensitively to sensory perturbations. We briefly review the dynamics of
perception, in terms of generalized Bayesian filtering and free energy
minimization, present a formal conjecture about self-organized instability and
then test this conjecture, using neuronal (numerical) simulations of perceptual
categorization.

Communication before coherence.

The hypothesis of communication through coherence proposes that coherent or
synchronous oscillations in connected neural systems can promote communication.
It has been applied mainly to how oscillations interact in connected networks. We
tested by simulations whether information transmission about an external stimulus
from one network to a second network is influenced by gamma oscillations, by
whether the oscillations are coherent, and by their phase. Gamma oscillations
were induced by increasing the relative conductance of AMPA to NMDA excitatory
synapses. It was found that small associative connection strengths between the
networks were sufficient to produce information transmission (measured by Shannon
mutual information) such that the second attractor network took the correct
decision based on the state of the first network. Although gamma oscillations
were present in both networks, the synaptic connections sufficient for perfect
information transmission about the stimulus presented to the network (100%
correct, 1 bit of information) were insufficiently strong to produce coherence,
or phase-locking, between the two networks; this only occurred when the synaptic 
strengths between the networks were increased by > 10 ×. Further, the phase of
the oscillations between the networks did not influence the information
transmission or its speed at these connection strengths. Moreover, information
transmission was as good when the AMPA-to-NMDA ratio was reduced to its normal
value, and oscillations were not present. Similar results were found when the
second network was not an attractor decision-making network. Thus information
transmission can occur before synapses have been made sufficiently strong to
produce coherence.

Modeling the outcome of structural disconnection on resting-state functional
connectivity.

A growing body of experimental evidence suggests that functional connectivity at 
rest is shaped by the underlying anatomical structure. Furthermore, the
organizational properties of resting-state functional networks are thought to
serve as the basis for an optimal cognitive integration. A disconnection at the
structural level, as occurring in some brain diseases, would then lead to
functional and presumably cognitive impairments. In this work, we propose a
computational model to investigate the role of a structural disconnection
(encompassing putative local/global and axonal/synaptic mechanisms) on the
organizational properties of emergent functional networks. The brain's
spontaneous neural activity and the corresponding hemodynamic response were
simulated using a large-scale network model, consisting of local neural
populations coupled through white matter fibers. For a certain coupling strength,
simulations reproduced healthy resting-state functional connectivity with graph
properties in the range of the ones reported experimentally. When the structural 
connectivity is decreased, either globally or locally, the resultant simulated
functional connectivity exhibited a network reorganization characterized by an
increase in hierarchy, efficiency and robustness, a decrease in small-worldness
and clustering and a narrower degree distribution, in the same way as recently
reported for schizophrenia patients. Theoretical results indicate that most
disconnection-related neuropathologies should induce the same qualitative changes
in resting-state brain activity.

Neuronal discharges in the primate temporal lobe, but not in the striate and
extrastriate cortex, reliably reflect stimulus awareness. However, it is not
clear whether visual consciousness should be uniquely localized in the temporal
association cortex. Here we used binocular flash suppression to investigate
whether visual awareness is also explicitly reflected in feature-selective neural
activity of the macaque lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), a cortical area
reciprocally connected to the temporal lobe. We show that neuronal discharges in 
the majority of single units and recording sites in the LPFC follow the
phenomenal perception of a preferred stimulus. Furthermore, visual awareness is
reliably reflected in the power modulation of high-frequency (>50 Hz) local field
potentials in sites where spiking activity is found to be perceptually modulated.
Our results suggest that the activity of neuronal populations in at least two
association cortical areas represents the content of conscious visual perception.

Neural network mechanisms underlying stimulus driven variability reduction.

Deco G(1), Hugues E.

Author information: 
(1)Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience Group, Center of Brain and
Cognition, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain. gustavo.deco@upf.edu

It is well established that the variability of the neural activity across trials,
as measured by the Fano factor, is elevated. This fact poses limits on
information encoding by the neural activity. However, a series of recent
neurophysiological experiments have changed this traditional view. Single cell
recordings across a variety of species, brain areas, brain states and stimulus
conditions demonstrate a remarkable reduction of the neural variability when an
external stimulation is applied and when attention is allocated towards a
stimulus within a neuron's receptive field, suggesting an enhancement of
information encoding. Using an heterogeneously connected neural network model
whose dynamics exhibits multiple attractors, we demonstrate here how this
variability reduction can arise from a network effect. In the spontaneous state, 
we show that the high degree of neural variability is mainly due to
fluctuation-driven excursions from attractor to attractor. This occurs when, in
the parameter space, the network working point is around the bifurcation allowing
multistable attractors. The application of an external excitatory drive by
stimulation or attention stabilizes one specific attractor, eliminating in this
way the transitions between the different attractors and resulting in a net
decrease in neural variability over trials. Importantly, non-responsive neurons
also exhibit a reduction of variability. Finally, this reduced variability is
found to arise from an increased regularity of the neural spike trains. In
conclusion, these results suggest that the variability reduction under
stimulation and attention is a property of neural circuits.

Ongoing cortical activity at rest: criticality, multistability, and ghost
attractors.

The ongoing activity of the brain at rest, i.e., under no stimulation and in
absence of any task, is astonishingly highly structured into spatiotemporal
patterns. These spatiotemporal patterns, called resting state networks, display
low-frequency characteristics (<0.1 Hz) observed typically in the BOLD-fMRI
signal of human subjects. We aim here to understand the origins of resting state 
activity through modeling via a global spiking attractor network of the brain.
This approach offers a realistic mechanistic model at the level of each single
brain area based on spiking neurons and realistic AMPA, NMDA, and GABA synapses. 
Integrating the biologically realistic diffusion tensor imaging/diffusion
spectrum imaging-based neuroanatomical connectivity into the brain model, the
resultant emerging resting state functional connectivity of the brain network
fits quantitatively best the experimentally observed functional connectivity in
humans when the brain network operates at the edge of instability. Under these
conditions, the slow fluctuating (<0.1 Hz) resting state networks emerge as
structured noise fluctuations around a stable low firing activity equilibrium
state in the presence of latent "ghost" multistable attractors. The multistable
attractor landscape defines a functionally meaningful dynamic repertoire of the
brain network that is inherently present in the neuroanatomical connectivity.

Despite the absence of stimulation or task conditions the cortex exhibits highly 
structured spatio-temporal activity patterns. These patterns are known as resting
state networks (RSNs) and emerge as low-frequency fluctuations (<0.1 Hz) observed
in the fMRI signal of human subjects during rest. We are interested in the
relationship between structural connectivity of the cortex and the fluctuations
exhibited during resting conditions. We are especially interested in the effect
of degree of connectivity on resting state dynamics as the default mode network
(DMN) is highly connected. We find in experimental resting fMRI data that the DMN
is the functional network that is most frequently active and for the longest
time. In large-scale computational simulations of the cortex based on the
corresponding underlying DTI/DSI based neuroanatomical connectivity matrix, we
additionally find a strong correlation between the mean degree of functional
networks and the proportion of time they are active. By artificially modifying
different types of neuroanatomical connectivity matrices in the model, we were
able to demonstrate that only models based on structural connectivity containing 
hubs give rise to this relationship. We conclude that, during rest, the cortex
alternates efficiently between explorations of its externally oriented functional
repertoire and internally oriented processing as a consequence of the DMN's high 
degree of connectivity.

Perceptual learning with perceptions.

Stemme A, Deco G, Lang EW.

In this work we present an approach to understand neuronal mechanisms underlying 
perceptual learning. Experimental results achieved with stimulus patterns of
coherently moving dots are considered to build a simple neuronal model. The
design of the model is made transparent and underlying behavioral assumptions
made explicit. The key aspect of the suggested neuronal model is the learning
algorithm used: We evaluated an implementation of Hebbian learning and are thus
able to provide a straight-forward model capable to explain the neuronal dynamics
underlying perceptual learning. Moreover, the simulation results suggest a very
simple explanation for the aspect of "sub-threshold" learning (Watanabe et al. in
Nature 413:844-884, 2001) as well as the relearning of motion discrimination
after damage to primary visual cortex as recently reported (Huxlin et al. in J
Neurosci 29:3981-3991, 2009) and at least indicate that perceptual learning might
only occur when accompanied by conscious percepts.ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY

Balanced input allows optimal encoding in a stochastic binary neural network
model: an analytical study.

Recent neurophysiological experiments have demonstrated a remarkable effect of
attention on the underlying neural activity that suggests for the first time that
information encoding is indeed actively influenced by attention. Single cell
recordings show that attention reduces both the neural variability and
correlations in the attended condition with respect to the non-attended one. This
reduction of variability and redundancy enhances the information associated with 
the detection and further processing of the attended stimulus. Beyond the
attentional paradigm, the local activity in a neural circuit can be modulated in 
a number of ways, leading to the general question of understanding how the
activity of such circuits is sensitive to these relatively small modulations.
Here, using an analytically tractable neural network model, we demonstrate how
this enhancement of information emerges when excitatory and inhibitory synaptic
currents are balanced. In particular, we show that the network encoding
sensitivity--as measured by the Fisher information--is maximized at the exact
balance. Furthermore, we find a similar result for a more realistic spiking
neural network model. As the regime of balanced inputs has been experimentally
observed, these results suggest that this regime is functionally important from
an information encoding standpoint.

Brain mechanisms for perceptual and reward-related decision-making.

Phenomenological models of decision-making, including the drift-diffusion and
race models, are compared with mechanistic, biologically plausible models, such
as integrate-and-fire attractor neuronal network models. The attractor network
models show how decision confidence is an emergent property; and make testable
predictions about the neural processes (including neuronal activity and fMRI
signals) involved in decision-making which indicate that the medial prefrontal
cortex is involved in reward value-based decision-making. Synaptic facilitation
in these models can help to account for sequential vibrotactile decision-making, 
and for how postponed decision-related responses are made. The randomness in the 
neuronal spiking-related noise that makes the decision-making probabilistic is
shown to be increased by the graded firing rate representations found in the
brain, to be decreased by the diluted connectivity, and still to be significant
in biologically large networks with thousands of synapses onto each neuron. The
stability of these systems is shown to be influenced in different ways by
glutamatergic and GABAergic efficacy, leading to a new field of dynamical
neuropsychiatry with applications to understanding schizophrenia and
obsessive-compulsive disorder. The noise in these systems is shown to be
advantageous, and to apply to similar attractor networks involved in short-term
memory, long-term memory, attention, and associative thought processes.

Cortical microcircuit dynamics mediating binocular rivalry: the role of
adaptation in inhibition.

Perceptual bistability arises when two conflicting interpretations of an
ambiguous stimulus or images in binocular rivalry (BR) compete for perceptual
dominance. From a computational point of view, competition models based on
cross-inhibition and adaptation have shown that noise is a crucial force for
rivalry, and operates in balance with adaptation. In particular, noise-driven
transitions and adaptation-driven oscillations define two dynamical regimes and
the system explains the observed alternations in perception when it operates near
their boundary. In order to gain insights into the microcircuit dynamics
mediating spontaneous perceptual alternations, we used a reduced recurrent
attractor-based biophysically realistic spiking network, well known for working
memory, attention, and decision making, where a spike-frequency adaptation
mechanism is implemented to account for perceptual bistability. We thus derived a
consistently reduced four-variable population rate model using mean-field
techniques, and we tested it on BR data collected from human subjects. Our model 
accounts for experimental data parameters such as mean time dominance,
coefficient of variation, and gamma distribution fit. In addition, we show that
our model operates near the bifurcation that separates the noise-driven
transitions regime from the adaptation-driven oscillations regime, and agrees
with Levelt's second revised and fourth propositions. These results demonstrate
for the first time that a consistent reduction of a biophysically realistic
spiking network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with spike-frequency
adaptation could account for BR. Moreover, we demonstrate that BR can be
explained only through the dynamics of competing neuronal pools, without taking
into account the adaptation of inhibitory interneurons. However, the adaptation
of interneurons affects the optimal parametric space of the system by decreasing 
the overall adaptation necessary for the bifurcation to occur, and introduces
oscillations in the spontaneous state.

Slow Modulation of Ongoing Discharge in the Auditory Cortex during an
Interval-Discrimination Task.

Author information:

In this study, we recorded single unit activity from rat auditory cortex while
the animals performed an interval-discrimination task. The animals had to decide 
whether two auditory stimuli were separated by either 150 or 300 ms, and go to
the left or right nose poke accordingly. Spontaneous firing in between auditory
responses was compared in the attentive versus non-attentive brain states. We
describe the firing rate modulation detected during intervals while there was no 
auditory stimulation. Nearly 18% of neurons (n = 14) showed a prominent neuronal 
discharge during the interstimulus interval, in the form of an upward or downward
ramp towards the second auditory stimulus. These patterns of spontaneous activity
were often modulated in the attentive versus passive trials. Modulation of the
spontaneous firing rate during the task was observed not only between auditory
stimuli, but also in the interval preceding the stimulus. These slow modulatory
components could be locally generated or the result of a top-down influence
originated in higher associative association areas. Such a neuronal discharge may
be related to the computation of the interval time and contribute to the
perception of the auditory stimulus.

Noise in attractor networks in the brain produced by graded firing rate
representations.

Webb TJ(1), Rolls ET, Deco G, Feng J.

Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom.

Representations in the cortex are often distributed with graded firing rates in
the neuronal populations. The firing rate probability distribution of each neuron
to a set of stimuli is often exponential or gamma. In processes in the brain,
such as decision-making, that are influenced by the noise produced by the close
to random spike timings of each neuron for a given mean rate, the noise with this
graded type of representation may be larger than with the binary firing rate
distribution that is usually investigated. In integrate-and-fire simulations of
an attractor decision-making network, we show that the noise is indeed greater
for a given sparseness of the representation for graded, exponential, than for
binary firing rate distributions. The greater noise was measured by faster
escaping times from the spontaneous firing rate state when the decision cues are 
applied, and this corresponds to faster decision or reaction times. The greater
noise was also evident as less stability of the spontaneous firing state before
the decision cues are applied. The implication is that spiking-related noise will
continue to be a factor that influences processes such as decision-making, signal
detection, short-term memory, and memory recall even with the quite large
networks found in the cerebral cortex. In these networks there are several
thousand recurrent collateral synapses onto each neuron. The greater noise with
graded firing rate distributions has the advantage that it can increase the speed
of operation of cortical circuitry.

The timing of vision - how neural processing links to different temporal
dynamics.

Masquelier T(1), Albantakis L, Deco G.

(1)Unit for Brain and Cognition, Department of Information and Communication
Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona, Spain.

In this review, we describe our recent attempts to model the neural correlates of
visual perception with biologically inspired networks of spiking neurons,
emphasizing the dynamical aspects. Experimental evidence suggests distinct
processing modes depending on the type of task the visual system is engaged in. A
first mode, crucial for object recognition, deals with rapidly extracting the
glimpse of a visual scene in the first 100 ms after its presentation. The
promptness of this process points to mainly feedforward processing, which relies 
on latency coding, and may be shaped by spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).
Our simulations confirm the plausibility and efficiency of such a scheme. A
second mode can be engaged whenever one needs to perform finer perceptual
discrimination through evidence accumulation on the order of 400 ms and above.
Here, our simulations, together with theoretical considerations, show how
predominantly local recurrent connections and long neural time-constants enable
the integration and build-up of firing rates on this timescale. In particular, we
review how a non-linear model with attractor states induced by strong recurrent
connectivity provides straightforward explanations for several recent
experimental observations. A third mode, involving additional top-down
attentional signals, is relevant for more complex visual scene processing. In the
model, as in the brain, these top-down attentional signals shape visual
processing by biasing the competition between different pools of neurons. The
winning pools may not only have a higher firing rate, but also more synchronous
oscillatory activity. This fourth mode, oscillatory activity, leads to faster
reaction times and enhanced information transfers in the model. This has indeed
been observed experimentally. Moreover, oscillatory activity can format spike
times and encode information in the spike phases with respect to the oscillatory 
cycle. This phenomenon is referred to as "phase-of-firing coding," and
experimental evidence for it is accumulating in the visual system. Simulations
show that this code can again be efficiently decoded by STDP. Future work should 
focus on continuous natural vision, bio-inspired hardware vision systems, and
novel experimental paradigms to further distinguish current modeling approaches.

Attractor networks successfully account for psychophysical and neurophysiological
data in various decision-making tasks. Especially their ability to model
persistent activity, a property of many neurons involved in decision-making,
distinguishes them from other approaches. Stable decision attractors are,
however, counterintuitive to changes of mind. Here we demonstrate that a
biophysically-realistic attractor network with spiking neurons, in its itinerant 
transients towards the choice attractors, can replicate changes of mind observed 
recently during a two-alternative random-dot motion (RDM) task. Based on the
assumption that the brain continues to evaluate available evidence after the
initiation of a decision, the network predicts neural activity during changes of 
mind and accurately simulates reaction times, performance and percentage of
changes dependent on difficulty. Moreover, the model suggests a low decision
threshold and high incoming activity that drives the brain region involved in the
decision-making process into a dynamical regime close to a bifurcation, which up 
to now lacked evidence for physiological relevance. Thereby, we further affirmed 
the general conformance of attractor networks with higher level neural processes 
and offer experimental predictions to distinguish nonlinear attractor from linear
diffusion models.

Neural and computational mechanisms of postponed decisions.

Martínez-García M(1), Rolls ET, Deco G, Romo R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Technology, Computational Neuroscience, Universitat Pompeu
Fabra, 08018 Barcelona, Spain.

We consider the mechanisms that enable decisions to be postponed for a period
after the evidence has been provided. Using an information theoretic approach, we
show that information about the forthcoming action becomes available from the
activity of neurons in the medial premotor cortex in a sequential decision-making
task after the second stimulus is applied, providing the information for a
decision about whether the first or second stimulus is higher in vibrotactile
frequency. The information then decays in a 3-s delay period in which the
neuronal activity declines before the behavioral response can be made. The
information then increases again when the behavioral response is required. We
model this neuronal activity using an attractor decision-making network in which 
information reflecting the decision is maintained at a low level during the delay
period, and is then selectively restored by a nonspecific input when the response
is required. One mechanism for the short-term memory is synaptic facilitation,
which can implement a mechanism for postponed decisions that can be correct even 
when there is little neuronal firing during the delay period before the postponed
decision. Another mechanism is graded firing rates by different neurons in the
delay period, with restoration by the nonspecific input of the low-rate activity 
from the higher-rate neurons still firing in the delay period. These mechanisms
can account for the decision making and for the memory of the decision before a
response can be made, which are evident in the activity of neurons in the medial 
premotor cortex.

Cholinergic control of cortical network interactions enables feedback-mediated
attentional modulation.

Attention increases our ability to detect behaviorally relevant stimuli. At the
neuronal level this is supported by increased firing rates of neurons
representing the attended object. In primary visual cortex an attention-mediated 
activity increase depends on the presence of the neuromodulator acetylcholine.
Using a spiking network model of visual cortex we have investigated how
acetylcholine interacts with biased feedback to enable attentional processing.
Although acetylcholine affects cortical processing in a multitude of manners, we 
restricted our analysis to four of its main established actions. These were (i) a
reduction in firing rate adaptation by reduction in M-currents (muscarinic), (ii)
an increase in thalamocortical synaptic efficacy by nicotinic presynaptic
receptors, (iii) a reduction in lateral interactions by muscarinic presynaptic
receptors, and (iv) an increase in inhibitory drive by muscarinic receptors
located on inhibitory interneurons. We found that acetylcholine contributes to
feedback-mediated attentional modulation, mostly by reducing intracortical
interactions and also to some extent by increasing the inhibitory drive. These
findings help explain why acetylcholine is necessary for top-down-driven
attentional modulation, and suggest a close interdependence of cholinergic and
feedback drive in mediating cognitive function.

Spatio-temporally organized low-frequency fluctuations (<0.1 Hz), observed in
BOLD fMRI signal during rest, suggest the existence of underlying network
dynamics that emerge spontaneously from intrinsic brain processes. Furthermore,
significant correlations between distinct anatomical regions-or functional
connectivity (FC)-have led to the identification of several widely distributed
resting-state networks (RSNs). This slow dynamics seems to be highly structured
by anatomical connectivity but the mechanism behind it and its relationship with 
neural activity, particularly in the gamma frequency range, remains largely
unknown. Indeed, direct measurements of neuronal activity have revealed similar
large-scale correlations, particularly in slow power fluctuations of local field 
potential gamma frequency range oscillations. To address these questions, we
investigated neural dynamics in a large-scale model of the human brain's neural
activity. A key ingredient of the model was a structural brain network defined by
empirically derived long-range brain connectivity together with the corresponding
conduction delays. A neural population, assumed to spontaneously oscillate in the
gamma frequency range, was placed at each network node. When these oscillatory
units are integrated in the network, they behave as weakly coupled oscillators.
The time-delayed interaction between nodes is described by the Kuramoto model of 
phase oscillators, a biologically-based model of coupled oscillatory systems. For
a realistic setting of axonal conduction speed, we show that time-delayed network
interaction leads to the emergence of slow neural activity fluctuations, whose
patterns correlate significantly with the empirically measured FC. The best
agreement of the simulated FC with the empirically measured FC is found for a set
of parameters where subsets of nodes tend to synchronize although the network is 
not globally synchronized. Inside such clusters, the simulated BOLD signal
between nodes is found to be correlated, instantiating the empirically observed
RSNs. Between clusters, patterns of positive and negative correlations are
observed, as described in experimental studies. These results are found to be
robust with respect to a biologically plausible range of model parameters. In
conclusion, our model suggests how resting-state neural activity can originate
from the interplay between the local neural dynamics and the large-scale
structure of the brain.

Prediction of Decisions from Noise in the Brain before the Evidence is Provided.

Rolls ET(1), Deco G.

Author information: 
(1)Oxford Centre for Computational Neuroscience Oxford, UK.

Can decisions be predicted from brain activity? It is frequently difficult in
neuroimaging studies to determine this, because it is not easy to establish when 
the decision has been taken. In a rigorous approach to this issue, we show that
in a neurally plausible integrate-and-fire attractor-based model of
decision-making, the noise generated by the randomness in the spiking times of
neurons can be used to predict a decision for 0.5 s or more before the decision
cues are applied. The ongoing noise at the time the decision cues are applied
influences which decision will be taken. It is possible to predict on a single
trial to more than 68% correct which of two decisions will be taken. The
prediction is made from the spontaneous firing before the decision cues are
applied in the two populations of neurons that represent the decisions. Thus
decisions can be partly predicted even before the decision cues are applied, due 
to noise in the decision-making process. This analysis has interesting
implications for decision-making and free will, for it shows that random neuronal
firing times can influence a decision before the evidence for the decision has
been provided.

Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona, Spain.

Rhythmic neural synchronization is found throughout the brain during many
different tasks and even at rest. Beyond their underlying mechanisms, the
question of their role is still controversial. Modeling can bring insight on this
difficult question. We review here our recent modeling results concerning this
issue in different situations. During rest, we show how local rhythmic synchrony 
can induce a spatiotemporally organized spontaneous activity at the brain level. 
Then, we show how rhythmic synchrony decreases reaction time in attention and
enhances the strength and speed of information transfer between different groups 
of neurons. Finally, we show that when rhythmic synchrony creates firing phases, 
the learning with spike timing-dependent plasticity of repeatedly presented input
patterns is greatly enhanced.

Bridging the gap between physiology and behavior: evidence from the sSoTS model
of human visual attention.

Mavritsaki E(1), Heinke D, Allen H, Deco G, Humphreys GW.

We present the case for a role of biologically plausible neural network modeling 
in bridging the gap between physiology and behavior. We argue that spiking-level 
networks can allow "vertical" translation between physiological properties of
neural systems and emergent "whole-system" performance-enabling psychological
results to be simulated from implemented networks and also inferences to be made 
from simulations concerning processing at a neural level. These models also
emphasize particular factors (e.g., the dynamics of performance in relation to
real-time neuronal processing) that are not highlighted in other approaches and
that can be tested empirically. We illustrate our argument from neural-level
models that select stimuli by biased competition. We show that a model with
biased competition dynamics can simulate data ranging from physiological studies 
of single-cell activity (Study 1) to whole-system behavior in human visual search
(Study 2), while also capturing effects at an intermediate level, including
performance breakdown after neural lesion (Study 3) and data from brain imaging
(Study 4). We also show that, at each level of analysis, novel predictions can be
derived from the biologically plausible parameters adopted, which we proceed to
test (Study 5). We argue that, at least for studying the dynamics of visual
attention, the approach productively links single-cell to psychological data.

Neuronal adaptation effects in decision making.

Recently, there has been an increased interest on the neural mechanisms
underlying perceptual decision making. However, the effect of neuronal adaptation
in this context has not yet been studied. We begin our study by investigating how
adaptation can bias perceptual decisions. We considered behavioral data from an
experiment on high-level adaptation-related aftereffects in a perceptual decision
task with ambiguous stimuli on humans. To understand the driving force behind the
perceptual decision process, a biologically inspired cortical network model was
used. Two theoretical scenarios arose for explaining the perceptual switch from
the category of the adaptor stimulus to the opposite, nonadapted one. One is
noise-driven transition due to the probabilistic spike times of neurons and the
other is adaptation-driven transition due to afterhyperpolarization currents.
With increasing levels of neural adaptation, the system shifts from a
noise-driven to an adaptation-driven modus. The behavioral results show that the 
underlying model is not just a bistable model, as usual in the decision-making
modeling literature, but that neuronal adaptation is high and therefore the
working point of the model is in the oscillatory regime. Using the same model
parameters, we studied the effect of neural adaptation in a perceptual
decision-making task where the same ambiguous stimulus was presented with and
without a preceding adaptor stimulus. We find that for different levels of
sensory evidence favoring one of the two interpretations of the ambiguous
stimulus, higher levels of neural adaptation lead to quicker decisions
contributing to a speed-accuracy trade off.

The authors review evidence that spontaneous, that is, not stimulus or task
driven, activity in the brain at the level of large-scale neural systems is not
noise, but orderly and organized in a series of functional networks that
maintain, at all times, a high level of coherence. These networks of spontaneous 
activity correlation or resting state networks (RSN) are closely related to the
underlying anatomical connectivity, but their topography is also gated by the
history of prior task activation. Network coherence does not depend on covert
cognitive activity, but its strength and integrity relates to behavioral
performance. Some RSN are functionally organized as dynamically competing systems
both at rest and during tasks. Computational studies show that one of such
dynamics, the anticorrelation between networks, depends on noise-driven
transitions between different multistable cluster synchronization states. These
multistable states emerge because of transmission delays between regions that are
modeled as coupled oscillators systems. Large-scale systems dynamics are useful
for keeping different functional subnetworks in a state of heightened
competition, which can be stabilized and fired by even small modulations of
either sensory or internal signals.

A broad body of experimental work has demonstrated that apparently spontaneous
brain activity is not random. At the level of large-scale neural systems, as
measured with functional MRI (fMRI), this ongoing activity reflects the
organization of a series of highly coherent functional networks. These so-called 
resting-state networks (RSNs) closely relate to the underlying anatomical
connectivity but cannot be understood in those terms alone. Here we review three 
large-scale neural system models of primate neocortex that emphasize the key
contributions of local dynamics, signal transmission delays and noise to the
emerging RSNs. We propose that the formation and dissolution of resting-state
patterns reflects the exploration of possible functional network configurations
around a stable anatomical skeleton.

In recent experimental work it has been shown that neuronal interactions are
modulated by neuronal synchronization and that this modulation depends on phase
shifts in neuronal oscillations. This result suggests that connections in a
network can be shaped through synchronization. Here, we test and expand this
hypothesis using a model network. We use transfer entropy, an information
theoretical measure, to quantify the exchanged information. We show that
transferred information depends on the phase relation of the signal, that the
amount of exchanged information increases as a function of oscillations in the
signal and that the speed of the information transfer increases as a function of 
synchronization. This implies that synchronization makes information transport
more efficient. In summary, our results reinforce the hypothesis that
synchronization modulates neuronal interactions and provide further evidence that
gamma band synchronization has behavioral relevance.

Computational neuroscience integrate-and-fire attractor network models can be
used to understand the factors that alter the stability of cortical networks in
the face of noise caused for example by neuronal spiking times. A reduction of
the firing rates of cortical neurons caused for example by reduced NMDA receptor 
function (present in schizophrenia) can lead to instability of the high firing
rate attractor states that normally implement short-term memory and attention,
contributing to the cognitive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Reduced
cortical inhibition caused by a reduction of GABA neurotransmission (present in
schizophrenia) can lead to instability of the spontaneous firing states of
cortical networks, leading to a noise-induced jump to a high firing rate
attractor state even in the absence of external inputs, contributing to the
positive symptoms of schizophrenia. We consider how effects occurring at the time
of late adolescence including synaptic pruning, decreases in grey matter volume, 
and changes in GABA-mediated inhibition and dopamine may contribute to the onset 
in some individuals of schizophrenia at this time.

Decision-making, errors, and confidence in the brain.

Rolls ET(1), Grabenhorst F, Deco G.

Edmund.Rolls@oxcns.org

To provide a fundamental basis for understanding decision-making and decision
confidence, we analyze a neuronal spiking attractor-based model of
decision-making. The model predicts probabilistic decision-making with larger
neuronal responses and larger functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses on correct than on error trials
because the spiking noise-influenced decision attractor state of the network is
consistent with the external evidence. Moreover, the model predicts that the
neuronal activity and the BOLD response will become larger on correct trials as
the discriminability ΔI increases and confidence increases and will become
smaller as confidence decreases on error trials as ΔI increases. Confidence is
thus an emergent property of the model. In an fMRI study of an olfactory
decision-making task, we confirm these predictions for cortical areas including
medial prefrontal cortex and the cingulate cortex implicated in choice
decision-making, showing a linear increase in the BOLD signal with ΔI on correct 
trials, and a linear decrease on error trials. These effects were not found in a 
control area, the orbitofrontal cortex, where reward value useful for the choice 
is represented on a continuous scale but that is not implicated in the choice
itself. This provides a unifying approach to decision-making and decision
confidence and to how spiking-related noise affects choice, confidence, synaptic 
and neuronal activity, and fMRI signals.

Choice, difficulty, and confidence in the brain.

Edmund.Rolls@oxcns.org

To provide a neurobiological basis for understanding decision-making and decision
confidence, we describe and analyze a neuronal spiking attractor-based model of
decision-making that makes predictions about synaptic and neuronal activity, the 
fMRI BOLD response, and behavioral choice as a function of the easiness of the
decision, and thus decision confidence. The spiking network model predicts
probabilistic decision-making with faster and larger neuronal responses on easy
versus difficult choices, that is as the discriminability DeltaI between the
choices increases, and these and the synaptic currents in turn predict larger
BOLD responses as the discriminability increases. Confidence, which increases
with discriminability, thus emerges from the firing rates of the decision-making 
neurons in the choice attractor network. In two fMRI studies, we confirm these
predictions by showing that brain areas such as medial prefrontal cortex area 10 
implicated in choice decision-making between pleasant stimuli have BOLD
activations linearly related to the easiness of both olfactory and warm
pleasantness choices. Further, this signature is not found in orbitofrontal
cortex areas that represent on a continuous scale the value of the stimuli, but
are not implicated in the choice itself. This provides a unifying and fundamental
approach to decision-making and decision confidence, and to how spiking-related
noise in the brain affects choice, confidence, synaptic and neuronal activity,
and fMRI signals.

Neurons have been recorded that reflect in their firing rates the confidence in a
decision. Here we show how this could arise as an emergent property in an
integrate-and-fire attractor network model of decision making. The attractor
network has populations of neurons that respond to each of the possible choices, 
each biased by the evidence for that choice, and there is competition between the
attractor states until one population wins the competition and finishes with high
firing that represents the decision. Noise resulting from the random spiking
times of individual neurons makes the decision making probabilistic. We also show
that a second attractor network can make decisions based on the confidence in the
first decision. This system is supported by and accounts for neuronal responses
recorded during decision making and makes predictions about the neuronal activity
that will be found when a decision is made about whether to stay with a first
decision or to abort the trial and start again. The research shows how monitoring
can be performed in the brain and this has many implications for understanding
cognitive functioning.

Recerca i Estudis Avançats, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, 08018 Barcelona, Spain.

During decision making between sequential stimuli, the first stimulus must be
held in memory and then compared with the second. Here, we show that in systems
that encode the stimuli by their firing rate, neurons can use synaptic
facilitation not only to remember the first stimulus during the delay but during 
the presentation of the second stimulus so that they respond to a combination of 
the first and second stimuli, as has been found for "partial differential"
neurons recorded in the ventral premotor cortex during vibrotactile flutter
frequency decision making. Moreover, we show that such partial differential
neurons provide important input to a subsequent attractor decision-making network
that can then compare this combination of the first and second stimuli with
inputs from other neurons that respond only to the second stimulus. Thus, both
synaptic facilitation and neuronal attractor dynamics can account for sequential 
decision making in such systems in the brain.

Apparent motion (AM) is a robust visual illusion, in which fast displays of
static objects in successively different positions elicit the perception of
object motion. Neurons in higher order areas 21 and 19 compute object motion
under such conditions and send feedback to early visual areas 18 and 17, which is
instrumental in eliciting computation of motion in those very areas. To explore
the computational dynamics of AM, we made a neural field model consisting of two 
one-dimensional rings of simple neurons expressing firing rates, one for areas
17/18 and one for areas 19/21. The model neurons, without any orientation or
direction selectivity, computed apparent motion for the range of space-timings of
stimuli associated with short- and long-range AM in humans. The computation of
long-range AM in 17/18 required two model areas and the presence of feedback and 
conduction/computation delays between those areas. As in the in vivo experiments 
of long-range AM, the stationary stimuli were initially mapped as stationary in
model area 17/18, but after the feedback also these lower areas computed AM. The 
dynamics of the two-area network produces short-range and long-range apparent
motion for a large range of feedback strengths and a small range of lateral
excitation near the bifurcation to an amplitude instability. The computation of
AM in higher order areas was due to the neurons in these areas having large
receptive fields as a consequence of divergent feed-forward connectivity. This
implies that these areas compute long-range AM when early areas 17 and 18 do not,
and therefore higher order areas must enslave lower order areas to compute the
same, if the whole network is to arrive at a coherent perceptual solution.

Simulating posterior parietal damage in a biologically plausible framework:
neuropsychological tests of the search over time and space model.

The search over time and space (sSoTS) model attempts to simulate both the
spatial and the temporal aspects of human visual search using spiking level
neurons, which incorporate some biologically plausible aspects of neuronal
firing. The model contains pools of units that (a) code basic features of
objects, presumed to reside in the ventral visual stream, and (b) respond in a
feature-independent way to stimulation at their location, presumed to operate in 
the posterior parietal cortex. We examined the effects of selective lesioning
neurons responding to one side of the location map. Unilateral damage introduced 
spatial biases into selection that affected conjunction more than single-feature 
search. In addition, there was an impaired ability to segment stimuli over time
as well as space (e.g., in preview search). These results match previously
reported data on patients with posterior parietal lesions. In addition we show
that spatial biases in selection increase under conditions in which there is
decreased activity from excitatory neurotransmitters, mimicking effects of
reduced arousal. Further simulations explored the effects of time and of visual
grouping on extinction, generating predictions that were then tested empirically.
The model provides a framework for linking behavioural data from patients with
neural-level determinants of visual attention.

Effective reduced diffusion-models: a data driven approach to the analysis of
neuronal dynamics.

Deco G(1), Martí D, Ledberg A, Reig R, Sanchez Vives MV.

Author information:

We introduce in this paper a new method for reducing neurodynamical data to an
effective diffusion equation, either experimentally or using simulations of
biophysically detailed models. The dimensionality of the data is first reduced to
the first principal component, and then fitted by the stationary solution of a
mean-field-like one-dimensional Langevin equation, which describes the motion of 
a Brownian particle in a potential. The advantage of such description is that the
stationary probability density of the dynamical variable can be easily derived.
We applied this method to the analysis of cortical network dynamics during up and
down states in an anesthetized animal. During deep anesthesia, intracellularly
recorded up and down states transitions occurred with high regularity and could
not be adequately described by a one-dimensional diffusion equation. Under
lighter anesthesia, however, the distributions of the times spent in the up and
down states were better fitted by such a model, suggesting a role for noise in
determining the time spent in a particular state.

Oscillations, phase-of-firing coding, and spike timing-dependent plasticity: an
efficient learning scheme.

Recent experiments have established that information can be encoded in the spike 
times of neurons relative to the phase of a background oscillation in the local
field potential-a phenomenon referred to as "phase-of-firing coding" (PoFC).
These firing phase preferences could result from combining an oscillation in the 
input current with a stimulus-dependent static component that would produce the
variations in preferred phase, but it remains unclear whether these phases are an
epiphenomenon or really affect neuronal interactions-only then could they have a 
functional role. Here we show that PoFC has a major impact on downstream learning
and decoding with the now well established spike timing-dependent plasticity
(STDP). To be precise, we demonstrate with simulations how a single neuron
equipped with STDP robustly detects a pattern of input currents automatically
encoded in the phases of a subset of its afferents, and repeating at random
intervals. Remarkably, learning is possible even when only a small fraction of
the afferents ( approximately 10%) exhibits PoFC. The ability of STDP to detect
repeating patterns had been noted before in continuous activity, but it turns out
that oscillations greatly facilitate learning. A benchmark with more conventional
rate-based codes demonstrates the superiority of oscillations and PoFC for both
STDP-based learning and the speed of decoding: the oscillation partially formats 
the input spike times, so that they mainly depend on the current input currents, 
and can be efficiently learned by STDP and then recognized in just one
oscillation cycle. This suggests a major functional role for oscillatory brain
activity that has been widely reported experimentally.

Attention: oscillations and neuropharmacology.

Deco G(1), Thiele A.

Author information: 
(1)Computational Neuroscience Group, Department of Technology, Universitat Pompeu
Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.

Attention is a rich psychological and neurobiological construct that influences
almost all aspects of cognitive behaviour. It enables enhanced processing of
behaviourally relevant stimuli at the expense of irrelevant stimuli. At the
cellular level, rhythmic synchronization at local and long-range spatial scales
complements the attention-induced firing rate changes of neurons. The former is
hypothesized to enable efficient communication between neuronal ensembles tuned
to spatial and featural aspects of the attended stimulus. Recent modelling
studies suggest that the rhythmic synchronization in the gamma range may be
mediated by a fine balance between N-methyl-D-aspartate and
alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate postsynaptic currents,
whereas other studies have highlighted the possible contribution of the
neuromodulator acetylcholine. This review summarizes some recent modelling and
experimental studies investigating mechanisms of attention in sensory areas and
discusses possibilities of how glutamatergic and cholinergic systems could
contribute to increased processing abilities at the cellular and network level
during states of top-down attention.

Fabra, Barcelona, Spain. larissa.albantakis@upf.edu

During the last decades, research on binary decision making elucidated some of
the basic neural mechanisms underlying the decision-making process. Recently, the
focus of experimental as well as modeling studies began to shift from simple
binary choices to decision making with multiple alternatives. In this article, we
address the question how different numbers of choice alternatives might be
handled and encoded in the brain. We present a minimal, biophysically realistic
spiking neuron model for decision making with multiple alternatives. Our model
accounts for the relevant aspects of recent experimental data of a random-dot
motion-discrimination task on both the cellular and behavioral level. Notably,
all network parameters and inputs in our network are independent of the number of
possible alternatives used in the tested experimental paradigms (2 and 4
alternatives and 2 alternatives with an angular separation of 90 degrees ). This 
avoids the use of extra top-down regulation mechanisms to adapt the network to
the number of choices. Furthermore, we show that increasing the number of neurons
encoding each choice alternative is positively related to the network's capacity 
of choice-number-independent decision making. Consequently, our results suggest a
physiological advantage of a pooled, multineuron representation of choice
alternatives.

A growing body of neuroimaging research has documented that, in the absence of an
explicit task, the brain shows temporally coherent activity. This so-called
"resting state" activity or, more explicitly, the default-mode network, has been 
associated with daydreaming, free association, stream of consciousness, or inner 
rehearsal in humans, but similar patterns have also been found under anesthesia
and in monkeys. Spatiotemporal activity patterns in the default-mode network are 
both complex and consistent, which raises the question whether they are the
expression of an interesting cognitive architecture or the consequence of
intrinsic network constraints. In numerical simulation, we studied the dynamics
of a simplified cortical network using 38 noise-driven (Wilson-Cowan)
oscillators, which in isolation remain just below their oscillatory threshold.
Time delay coupling based on lengths and strengths of primate corticocortical
pathways leads to the emergence of 2 sets of 40-Hz oscillators. The sets showed
synchronization that was anticorrelated at <0.1 Hz across the sets in line with a
wide range of recent experimental observations. Systematic variation of
conduction velocity, coupling strength, and noise level indicate a high
sensitivity of emerging synchrony as well as simulated blood flow blood oxygen
level-dependent (BOLD) on the underlying parameter values. Optimal sensitivity
was observed around conduction velocities of 1-2 m/s, with very weak coupling
between oscillators. An additional finding was that the optimal noise level had a
characteristic scale, indicating the presence of stochastic resonance, which
allows the network dynamics to respond with high sensitivity to changes in
diffuse feedback activity.

The relatively random spiking times of individual neurons are a source of noise
in the brain. We show that in a finite-sized cortical attractor network, this can
be an advantage, for it leads to probabilistic behavior that is advantageous in
decision-making, by preventing deadlock, and is important in signal
detectability. We show how computations can be performed through stochastic
dynamical effects, including the role of noise in enabling probabilistic jumping 
across barriers in the energy landscape describing the flow of the dynamics in
attractor networks. The results obtained in neurophysiological studies of
decision-making and signal detectability are modelled by the stochastical
neurodynamics of integrate-and-fire networks of neurons with probabilistic
neuronal spiking. We describe how these stochastic neurodynamical effects can be 
analyzed, and their importance in many aspects of brain function, including
decision-making, memory recall, short-term memory, and attention.

Audiovisual matching in speech and nonspeech sounds: a neurodynamical model.

Loh M(1), Schmid G, Deco G, Ziegler W.

Author information: 
(1)Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.

Audiovisual speech perception provides an opportunity to investigate the
mechanisms underlying multimodal processing. By using nonspeech stimuli, it is
possible to investigate the degree to which audiovisual processing is specific to
the speech domain. It has been shown in a match-to-sample design that matching
across modalities is more difficult in the nonspeech domain as compared to the
speech domain. We constructed a biophysically realistic neural network model
simulating this experimental evidence. We propose that a stronger connection
between modalities in speech underlies the behavioral difference between the
speech and the nonspeech domain. This could be the result of more extensive
experience with speech stimuli. Because the match-to-sample paradigm does not
allow us to draw conclusions concerning the integration of auditory and visual
information, we also simulated two further conditions based on the same paradigm,
which tested the integration of auditory and visual information within a single
stimulus. New experimental data for these two conditions support the simulation
results and suggest that audiovisual integration of discordant stimuli is
stronger in speech than in nonspeech stimuli. According to the simulations, the
connection strength between auditory and visual information, on the one hand,
determines how well auditory information can be assigned to visual information,
and on the other hand, it influences the magnitude of multimodal integration.

In this work we address key phenomena observed with classical set shifting tasks 
as the "Wisconsin Card Sorting Test" or the "Stroop" task: Different types of
errors and increased response times reflecting decreased attention. A component
of major importance in these tasks is referred to as the "attentional control"
thought to be implemented by the prefrontal cortex which acts primarily by an
amplification of task relevant information. This mode of operation is illustrated
by a neurodynamical model developed for a new kind of set shifting experiment:
The Wisconsin-Delayed-Match-to-Sample task combines uninstructed shifts as
investigated in Wisconsin-like tasks with a Delayed-Match-to-Sample paradigm.
These newly developed WDMS experiments in conjunction with the neurodynamical
simulations are able to explain the reason for decreased attention in set
shifting experiments as well the different consequences of decreased attention in
tasks requiring bivalent yes/no responses compared to tasks requiring multivalent
responses.

multisensory integration. This article reviews and discusses current evidence for
multisensory contributions to the perception of vibratory events, and proposes a 
framework to address a number of relevant questions. First, we highlight some of 
the features that characterize the senses of hearing and touch in terms of
vibratory information processing, and which allow for potential cross-modal
interactions at multiple levels along the functional architecture of the sensory 
systems. Second, we briefly review empirical evidence for interactions between
hearing and touch in the domain of vibroactile perception and related stimulus
properties, covering behavioural, electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies
in humans and animals. Third, we discuss the vibrotactile discrimination task,
which has been successfully applied in the study of perception and decision
processes in psychophysical and physiological research. We argue that this
approach, complemented with computational modeling using biophysically realistic 
neural networks, may be a convenient framework to address auditory contributions 
to vibrotactile processing in the somatosensory system. Finally, we comment on a 
series of particular issues which are relevant in multisensory research and
potentially addressable within the proposed framework.

When listening to modified speech, either naturally or artificially altered, the 
human perceptual system rapidly adapts to it. There is some debate about the
nature of the mechanisms underlying this adaptation. Although some authors
propose that listeners modify their prelexical representations, others assume
changes at the lexical level. Recently, Larsson, Vera, Sebastian-Galles, and Deco
[Lexical plasticity in early bilinguals does not alter phoneme categories: I.
Neurodynamical modelling. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 20, 76-94, 2008]
proposed a biologically plausible computational model to account for some
existing data, one which successfully modeled how long-term exposure to a dialect
triggers the creation of new lexical entries. One specific prediction of the
model was that prelexical (phoneme) representations should not be affected by
dialectal exposure (as long as the listener is exposed to both standard and
dialectal pronunciations). Here we present a series of experiments testing the
predictions of the model. Native listeners of Catalan, with extended exposure to 
Spanish-accented Catalan, were tested on different auditory lexical decision
tasks and phoneme discrimination tasks. Behavioral and electrophysiological
recordings were obtained. The results supported the predictions of our model. On 
the one hand, both error rates and N400 measurements indicated the existence of
alternative lexical entries for dialectal varieties. On the other hand, no
evidence of alterations at the phoneme level, either in the behavioral
discrimination task or in the electrophysiological measurement (MMN), could be
detected. The results of the present study are compared with those obtained in
short-term laboratory exposures in an attempt to provide an integrative account.

Noise contributed by the probabilistic spiking times of neurons has an important 
and advantageous role in brain function. We go beyond the deterministic noiseless
description of the dynamics of cortical networks and show how the properties of
the system are influenced by the spiking noise. We review here recent results
that show the direct link between brain activity and psychophysically quantified 
behaviors during a somatosensory detection task. We focus on the following
remarkable observation in this somatosensory task: when a near-threshold stimulus
is presented, a sensory percept may or may not be produced. These perceptual
judgments are believed to be determined by the fluctuation in activity of early
sensory cortices. We show, however, that the behavioral outcomes associated with 
near-threshold stimuli depend on the neuronal fluctuations of more central areas 
to early somatosensory cortices. Furthermore, we show that the behavioral
correlate of perceptual detection is given by a noise-driven transition in a
multistable neurodynamical system. Thus, neuronal fluctuations can be an
advantage for brain processing because they lead to probabilistic behavior in
decision making in this and other sensory tasks.

The cortex is a complex system, characterized by its dynamics and architecture,
which underlie many functions such as action, perception, learning, language, and
cognition. Its structural architecture has been studied for more than a hundred
years; however, its dynamics have been addressed much less thoroughly. In this
paper, we review and integrate, in a unifying framework, a variety of
computational approaches that have been used to characterize the dynamics of the 
cortex, as evidenced at different levels of measurement. Computational models at 
different space-time scales help us understand the fundamental mechanisms that
underpin neural processes and relate these processes to neuroscience data.
Modeling at the single neuron level is necessary because this is the level at
which information is exchanged between the computing elements of the brain; the
neurons. Mesoscopic models tell us how neural elements interact to yield emergent
behavior at the level of microcolumns and cortical columns. Macroscopic models
can inform us about whole brain dynamics and interactions between large-scale
neural systems such as cortical regions, the thalamus, and brain stem. Each level
of description relates uniquely to neuroscience data, from single-unit
recordings, through local field potentials to functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and magnetoencephalogram (MEG).
Models of the cortex can establish which types of large-scale neuronal networks
can perform computations and characterize their emergent properties. Mean-field
and related formulations of dynamics also play an essential and complementary
role as forward models that can be inverted given empirical data. This makes
dynamic models critical in integrating theory and experiments. We argue that
elaborating principled and informed models is a prerequisite for grounding
empirical neuroscience in a cogent theoretical framework, commensurate with the
achievements in the physical sciences.

Computational models of schizophrenia and dopamine modulation in the prefrontal
cortex.

Computational neuroscience models can be used to understand the diminished
stability and noisy neurodynamical behaviour of prefrontal cortex networks in
schizophrenia. These neurodynamical properties can be captured by simulated
neural networks with randomly spiking neurons that introduce noise into the
system and produce trial-by-trial variation of postsynaptic potentials.
Theoretical and experimental studies have aimed to understand schizophrenia in
relation to noise and signal-to-noise ratio, which are promising concepts for
understanding the symptoms that characterize this heterogeneous illness.
Simulations of biologically realistic neural networks show how the functioning of
NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and dopamine
receptors is connected to the concepts of noise and variability, and to related
neurophysiological findings and clinical symptoms in schizophrenia.

An attractor hypothesis of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Author information:

Edmund.Rolls@oxcns.org

We propose a top-down approach to the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD) based on a statistical dynamical framework. An increased depth in the
basins of attraction of attractor network states in the brain makes each state
too stable, so that it tends to remain locked in that state and can not easily be
moved on to another state. We suggest that the different symptoms that may be
present in OCD could be related to changes of this type in different brain
regions. For example, the difficulty in attentional and cognitive set switching
could be related to networks operating in this way in the prefrontal cortex.
Repetitive actions and a difficulty in moving to new actions could be related to 
overstability in networks in the higher order motor, including cingulate areas.
In integrate-and-fire network simulations, an increase in the
N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and/or
alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor
conductances, which increases the depth of the attractor basins, increases the
stability of attractor networks, and makes them less easily moved on to another
state by a new stimulus. Increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-receptor
activated currents can partly reverse this overstability. There is now some
evidence for overactivity in glutamate transmitter systems in OCD, and the
hypothesis presented here shows how some of the symptoms of OCD could be produced
by the increase in the stability of attractor networks that is produced by
increased glutamatergic activity.

The neuronal basis of attention: rate versus synchronization modulation.

andres.buhlmann@upf.edu

Extensive theoretical and experimental work on the neuronal correlates of visual 
attention raises two hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms. The first
hypothesis, named biased competition, originates from experimental single-cell
recordings that have shown that attention upmodulates the firing rates of the
neurons encoding the attended features and downregulates the firing rates of the 
neurons encoding the unattended features. Furthermore, attentional modulation of 
firing rates increases along the visual pathway. The other, newer hypothesis
assigns synchronization a crucial role in the attentional process. It stems from 
experiments that have shown that attention modulates gamma-frequency
synchronization. In this paper, we study the coexistence of the two phenomena
using a theoretical framework. We find that the two effects can vary
independently of each other and across layers. Therefore, the two phenomena are
not concomitant. However, we show that there is an advantage in the processing of
information if rate modulation is accompanied by gamma modulation, namely that
reaction times are shorter, implying behavioral relevance for gamma
synchronization.

The spike activity of cells in some cortical areas has been found to be
correlated with reaction times and behavioral responses during two-choice
decision tasks. These experimental findings have motivated the study of
biologically plausible winner-take-all network models, in which strong recurrent 
excitation and feedback inhibition allow the network to form a categorical choice
upon stimulation. Choice formation corresponds in these models to the transition 
from the spontaneous state of the network to a state where neurons selective for 
one of the choices fire at a high rate and inhibit the activity of the other
neurons. This transition has been traditionally induced by an increase in the
external input that destabilizes the spontaneous state of the network and forces 
its relaxation to a decision state. Here we explore a different mechanism by
which the system can undergo such transitions while keeping the spontaneous state
stable, based on an escape induced by finite-size noise from the spontaneous
state. This decision mechanism naturally arises for low stimulus strengths and
leads to exponentially distributed decision times when the amount of noise in the
system is small. Furthermore, we show using numerical simulations that mean
decision times follow in this regime an exponential dependence on the amplitude
of noise. The escape mechanism provides thus a dynamical basis for the wide range
and variability of decision times observed experimentally.

Understanding the link between neurobiology and cognition requires that
neuroscience moves beyond mere structure-function correlations. An explicit
systems perspective is needed in which putative mechanisms of how brain function 
is constrained by brain structure are mathematically formalized and made
accessible for experimental investigation. Such a systems approach critically
rests on a better understanding of brain connectivity in its various forms. Since
2002, frontier topics of connectivity and neural system analysis have been
discussed in a multidisciplinary annual meeting, the Brain Connectivity Workshop 
(BCW), bringing together experimentalists and theorists from various fields. This
article summarizes some of the main discussions at the two most recent workshops,
2006 at Sendai, Japan, and 2007 at Barcelona, Spain: (i) investigation of
cortical micro- and macrocircuits, (ii) models of neural dynamics at multiple
scales, (iii) analysis of "resting state" networks, and (iv) linking anatomical
to functional connectivity. Finally, we outline some central challenges and
research trajectories in computational systems neuroscience for the next years.

Neural responses are most often characterized in terms of the sets of
environmental or internal conditions or stimuli with which their firing rate
[corrected]increases or decreases are correlated [corrected] Their transient
(nonstationary) temporal profiles of activity have received comparatively less
attention. Similarly, the computational framework of attractor neural networks
puts most emphasis on the representational or computational properties of the
stable states of a neural system. Here we review a couple of neurophysiological
observations and computational ideas that shift the focus to the transient
dynamics of neural systems. We argue that there are many situations in which the 
transient neural behaviour, while hopping between different attractor states or
moving along 'attractor ruins', carries most of the computational and/or
behavioural significance, rather than the attractor states eventually reached.
Such transients may be related to the computation of temporally precise
predictions or the probabilistic transitions among choice options, accounting for
Weber's law in decision-making tasks. Finally, we conclude with a more general
perspective on the role of transient dynamics in the brain, promoting the view
that brain activity is characterized by a high-dimensional chaotic ground state
from which transient spatiotemporal patterns (metastable states) briefly emerge. 
Neural computation has to exploit the itinerant dynamics between these states.

Perceptual detection as a dynamical bistability phenomenon: a neurocomputational

Recent studies that combined psychophysical/neurophysiological experiments [de
Lafuente V, Romo R (2005) Nat Neurosci 8:1698-1703] analyzed the responses from
single neurons, recorded in several cortical areas of parietal and frontal lobes,
while trained monkeys reported the presence or absence of a mechanical vibration 
of varying amplitude applied to skin of one fingertip. The analysis showed that
the activity of primary somatosensory cortex neurons covaried with the stimulus
strength but did not covary with the animal's perceptual reports. In contrast,
the activity of medial premotor cortex (MPC) neurons did not covary with the
stimulus strength but did covary with the animal's perceptual reports. Here, we
address the question of how perceptual detection is computed in MPC. In
particular, we regard perceptual detection as a bistable neurodynamical
phenomenon reflected in the activity of MPC. We show that the activity of MPC is 
consistent with a decision-making-like scenario of fluctuation-driven computation
that causes a probabilistic transition between two bistable states, one
corresponding to the case in which the monkey detects the sensory input, the
other corresponding to the case in which the monkey does not. Moreover, the high 
variability activity of MPC neurons both within and between trials reflects
stochastic fluctuations that may play a crucial role in the monkey's
probabilistic perceptual reports.

The prefrontal cortex is believed to be important for cognitive control, working 
memory, and learning. It is known to play an important role in the learning and
execution of conditional visuomotor associations, a cognitive task in which
stimuli have to be associated with actions by trial-and-error learning. In our
modeling study, we sought to integrate several hypotheses on the function of the 
prefrontal cortex using a computational model, and compare the results to
experimental data. We constructed a module of prefrontal cortex neurons exposed
to two different inputs, which we envision to originate from the inferotemporal
cortex and the basal ganglia. We found that working memory properties do not
describe the dominant dynamics in the prefrontal cortex, but the activation seems
to be transient, probably progressing along a pathway from sensory to motor
areas. During the presentation of the cue, the dynamics of the prefrontal cortex 
is bistable, yielding a distinct activation for correct and error trails. We find
that a linear change in network parameters relates to the changes in neural
activity in consecutive correct trials during learning, which is important
evidence for the underlying learning mechanisms.

A dynamical systems hypothesis of schizophrenia.

Loh M(1), Rolls ET, Deco G.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Technology, Universitas Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.

We propose a top-down approach to the symptoms of schizophrenia based on a
statistical dynamical framework. We show that a reduced depth in the basins of
attraction of cortical attractor states destabilizes the activity at the network 
level due to the constant statistical fluctuations caused by the stochastic
spiking of neurons. In integrate-and-fire network simulations, a decrease in the 
NMDA receptor conductances, which reduces the depth of the attractor basins,
decreases the stability of short-term memory states and increases
distractibility. The cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia such as distractibility,
working memory deficits, or poor attention could be caused by this instability of
attractor states in prefrontal cortical networks. Lower firing rates are also
produced, and in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex could account
for the negative symptoms, including a reduction of emotions. Decreasing the GABA
as well as the NMDA conductances produces not only switches between the attractor
states, but also jumps from spontaneous activity into one of the attractors. We
relate this to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, including delusions,
paranoia, and hallucinations, which may arise because the basins of attraction
are shallow and there is instability in temporal lobe semantic memory networks,
leading thoughts to move too freely round the attractor energy landscape.

Recent single-cell studies in monkeys (Romo et al., 2004) show that the activity 
of neurons in the ventral premotor cortex covaries with the animal's decisions in
a perceptual comparison task regarding the frequency of vibrotactile events. The 
firing rate response of these neurons was dependent only on the frequency
differences between the two applied vibrations, the sign of that difference being
the determining factor for correct task performance. We present a biophysically
realistic neurodynamical model that can account for the most relevant
characteristics of this decision-making-related neural activity. One of the
nontrivial predictions of this model is that Weber's law will underlie the
perceptual discrimination behavior. We confirmed this prediction in behavioral
tests of vibrotactile discrimination in humans and propose a computational
explanation of perceptual discrimination that accounts naturally for the
emergence of Weber's law. We conclude that the neurodynamical mechanisms and
computational principles underlying the decision-making processes in this
perceptual discrimination task are consistent with a fluctuation-driven scenario 
in a multistable regime.

Abstract Sebastián-Gallés et al. [The influence of initial exposure on lexical
representation: Comparing early and simultaneous bilinguals. Journal of Memory
and Language, 52, 240-255, 2005] contrasted highly proficient early
Spanish-Catalan and Catalan-Spanish bilinguals, using Catalan materials in a
lexical decision task (LDT). They constructed two types of experimental
pseudowords, substituting Catalan phoneme /e/ for Catalan /epsilon/, or vice
versa. Catalan-dominant bilinguals showed a performance asymmetry across
experimental conditions, making more mistakes for /epsilon/-->/e/ changes, than
for /e/-->/epsilon/ ones. This was considered evidence of a developed acceptance 
of mispronounced Catalan /epsilon/-words, caused by exposure to a bilingual
environment where mispronunciations by Spanish-dominant bilinguals using their
/e/-category abound. Although this indicated modified or added lexical
representations, an open issue is whether such lexical information also modifies 
phoneme categories. We address this using a biophysically realistic neurodynamic 
model, describing neural activity at the synaptic and spiking levels. We
construct a network of pools of neurons, representing phonemic and lexical
processing. Carefully analyzing the dependency of network dynamics on connection 
strengths, by first exploring parameter space under steady-state assumptions
(mean-field scans), then running spiking simulations, we investigate the neural
substrate role in a representative LDT. We also simulate a phoneme discrimination
task to address whether lexical changes affect the phonemic level. We find that
the same network configuration which displays asymmetry in the LDT shows equal
performance discriminating the two modeled phonemes. Thus, we predicted that the 
Catalan-dominant bilinguals do not alter their phoneme categories, although
showing signs of having stored a new word variation in the lexicon. To explore
this prediction, a syllable discrimination task involving the /e/-/epsilon/
contrast was set up, using Catalan-dominants displaying performance asymmetry in 
a repetition of the original LDT. Discrimination task results support the
prediction, showing that these subjects discriminate both categories equally
well. We conclude that subjects often exposed to dialectal word variations can
store these in their lexicons, without altering their phoneme representations.

Recent theories of visual perception propose that feedforward cortical processing
enables rapid and automatic object categorizations, yet incorporates a limited
amount of detail. Subsequent feedback processing highlights high-resolution
representations in early visual areas and provides spatial detail. To verify this
hypothesis, we separate the contributions of feedforward and feedback signals to 
the selectivity of cortical neurons in a neural network simulation that is
modeled after the hierarchical feedforward-feedback organization of cortical
areas. We find that in such a network the responses of high-level neurons can
initially distinguish between low-resolution aspects of objects but are 'blind'
to differences in detail. After several feedback-feedforward cycles of
processing, however, they can also distinguish between objects that differ in
detail. Moreover, we find that our model captures recent paradoxical results of
crowding phenomena, showing that spatial detail that is lost in visual crowding
is nevertheless able to evoke specific adaptation effects. Our results thus
provide an existence proof of the feasibility of novel theoretical models and
provide a mechanism to explain various psychophysical and physiological results.

The neuronal dynamics underlying cognitive flexibility in set shifting tasks.

The ability to switch attention from one aspect of an object to another or in
other words to switch the "attentional set" as investigated in tasks like the
"Wisconsin Card Sorting Test" is commonly referred to as cognitive flexibility.
In this work we present a biophysically detailed neurodynamical model which
illustrates the neuronal base of the processes related to this cognitive
flexibility. For this purpose we conducted behavioral experiments which allow the
combined evaluation of different aspects of set shifting tasks: uninstructed set 
shifts as investigated in Wisconsin-like tasks, effects of stimulus congruency as
investigated in Stroop-like tasks and the contribution of working memory as
investigated in "Delayed-Match-to-Sample" tasks. The work describes how general
experimental findings are usable to design the architecture of a biophysical
detailed though minimalistic model with a high orientation on neurobiological
findings and how, in turn, the simulations support experimental investigations.
The resulting model is able to account for experimental and individual response
times and error rates and enables the switch of attention as a system inherent
model feature: The switching process suggested by the model is based on the
memorization of the visual stimuli and does not require any synaptic learning.
The operation of the model thus demonstrates with at least a high probability the
neuronal dynamics underlying a key component of human behavior: the ability to
adapt behavior according to context requirements--cognitive flexibility.

The analysis of transitions in stochastic neurodynamical systems is essential to 
understand the computational principles that underlie those perceptual and
cognitive processes involving multistable phenomena, like decision making and
bistable perception. To investigate the role of noise in a multistable
neurodynamical system described by coupled differential equations, one usually
considers numerical simulations, which are time consuming because of the need for
sufficiently many trials to capture the statistics of the influence of the
fluctuations on that system. An alternative analytical approach involves the
derivation of deterministic differential equations for the moments of the
distribution of the activity of the neuronal populations. However, the
application of the method of moments is restricted by the assumption that the
distribution of the state variables of the system takes on a unimodal Gaussian
shape. We extend in this paper the classical moments method to the case of
bimodal distribution of the state variables, such that a reduced system of
deterministic coupled differential equations can be derived for the desired
regime of multistability.

Our aim has been to study visual search in hierarchical patterns through a
computational neuroscience perspective. In this way we were able to analyse the
relationship between the global precedence effect and attention. The theoretical 
part of our investigations extended a model built upon the biased-competition
hypothesis. An important feature of this extension is that different spatial
frequencies are processed with different time constants. Simulations with this
model resulted in specific predictions that were confirmed with a novel
visual-search experiment utilising hierarchical patterns. Both experiment and
simulations suggest that the global-precedence effect prevails under the
condition of visual search.

Many perceptual and cognitive processes, like decision-making and bistable
perception, involve multistable phenomena under the influence of noise. The role 
of noise in a multistable neurodynamical system can be formally treated within
the Fokker-Planck framework. Nevertheless, because of the underlying
nonlinearities, one usually considers numerical simulations of the stochastic
differential equations describing the original system, which are time consuming. 
An alternative analytical approach involves the derivation of reduced
deterministic differential equations for the moments of the distribution of the
activity of the neuronal populations. The study of the reduced deterministic
system avoids time consuming computations associated with the need to average
over many trials. We apply this technique to describe multistable phenomena. We
show that increasing the noise amplitude results in a shifting of the bifurcation
structure of the system.

In the real world, visual information is selected over time as well as space,
when we prioritise new stimuli for attention. Watson and Humphreys [Watson, D.,
Humphreys, G.W., 1997. Visual marking: prioritizing selection for new objects by 
top-down attentional inhibition of old objects. Psychological Review 104, 90-122]
presented evidence that new information in search tasks is prioritised by
(amongst other processes) active ignoring of old items - a process they termed
visual marking. In this paper we present, for the first time, an explicit
computational model of visual marking using biologically plausible activation
functions. The "spiking search over time and space" model (sSoTS) incorporates
different synaptic components (NMDA, AMPA, GABA) and a frequency adaptation
mechanism based on [Ca(2+)] sensitive K(+) current. This frequency adaptation
current can act as a mechanism that suppresses the previously attended items. We 
show that, when coupled with a process of active inhibition applied to old items,
frequency adaptation leads to old items being de-prioritised (and new items
prioritised) across time in search. Furthermore, the time course of these
processes mimics the time course of the preview effect in human search. The
results indicate that the sSoTS model can provide a biologically plausible
account of human search over time as well as space.

Attention in natural scenes: Neurophysiological and computational bases.

How does attention operate in natural scenes? We show that the receptive fields
of inferior temporal cortex neurons that implement object representations become 
small and located at the fovea in complex natural scenes. This facilitates the
readout of information about an object that may be reward or punishment
associated, and may be the target for action. Top-down biased competition to
implement attention has a much weaker effect in complex natural scenes than in
otherwise blank scenes with two objects. Part of the solution to the binding
problem is thus that competition and the foveal cortical magnification factor
emphasize what is present at the fovea, and limit the binding problem. Part of
the solution to the binding problem is that neurons respond to combinations of
features present in the correct relative spatial positions. Stimulus-dependent
neuronal synchrony does not appear to be quantitatively important in feature
binding, and in attention, in natural visual scenes, at least in the inferior
temporal visual cortex, as shown by information theoretic analyses. The
perception of multiple objects in a scene is facilitated by the fact that
inferior temporal visual cortex neurons have asymmetrical receptive fields with
respect to the fovea in complex scenes. Computational models of this processing
are described.

Decision-making and Weber's law: a neurophysiological model.

We describe an integrate-and-fire attractor model of the decision-related
activity of ventral premotor cortex (VPC) neurons during a vibrotactile frequency
comparison task [Romo et al. (2004)Neuron, 41, 165-173]. Populations of neurons
for each decision in a biased competition attractor network receive a bias input 
that depends on the firing rates of VPC neurons that code for the two
vibrotactile frequencies. The firing rate of the neurons in whichever attractor
wins, reflects the sign of the difference in the frequencies (Deltaf) being
compared but not the absolute frequencies. However, the transition from the
initial spontaneous firing state to one of the two possible attractor states
depends probabilistically on the difference of the vibrotactile frequencies
scaled by the base frequency. This is due to finite size noise effects related to
the spiking activity in the network, and the divisive feedback inhibition
implemented through inhibitory interneurons. Thus the neurophysiological basis
for a psychophysical effect, Weber's Law, can be related to statistical
fluctuations and divisive inhibition in an attractor decision-making network.

Learning to attend: modeling the shaping of selectivity in infero-temporal cortex
in a categorization task.

Recent experiments on behaving monkeys have shown that learning a visual
categorization task makes the neurons in infero-temporal cortex (ITC) more
selective to the task-relevant features of the stimuli (Sigala and Logothetis in 
Nature 415 318-320, 2002). We hypothesize that such a selectivity modulation
emerges from the interaction between ITC and other cortical area, presumably the 
prefrontal cortex (PFC), where the previously learned stimulus categories are
encoded. We propose a biologically inspired model of excitatory and inhibitory
spiking neurons with plastic synapses, modified according to a reward based
Hebbian learning rule, to explain the experimental results and test the validity 
of our hypothesis. We assume that the ITC neurons, receiving feature selective
inputs, form stronger connections with the category specific neurons to which
they are consistently associated in rewarded trials. After learning, the top-down
influence of PFC neurons enhances the selectivity of the ITC neurons encoding the
behaviorally relevant features of the stimuli, as observed in the experiments. We
conclude that the perceptual representation in visual areas like ITC can be
strongly affected by the interaction with other areas which are devoted to higher
cognitive functions.

Cognitive flexibility and decision-making in a model of conditional visuomotor
associations.

Arbitrary visuomotor associations map a stimulus onto a particular response upon 
reinforcing rewards. Changes in the associations between stimuli and responses
require the neural networks to discard the already learned mappings and build new
ones. This is a key aspect of cognitive flexibility. In addition, learning within
this experimental paradigm requires a trial-and-error exploration strategy of the
available stimulus-response associations. A system performing this task must be
able to both build up mappings for stimulus-response associations and at the same
time perform non-deterministically to explore the behavioural space until it
reaches certainty. We hypothesize an integrate-and-fire network model that
accounts for the neurophysiological data of a conditional visuomotor association 
task and is able to show non-deterministic behaviour. We aim at identifying
multistable attractor regimes in the network dynamics, which intrinsically enable
the system to make errors and thereby to perform trial-and-error exploration. Our
model combines cognitive flexibility with multistable attractors in
neurodynamical systems, believed to be the basis of decision-making. If
multistable attractors support the exploration of the behavioural space, then our
model predicts that the brain should respond stochastically with correct or
incorrect activity to visuomotor associations until it has reached certainty.
This should be visible not only in the corresponding activity in the premotor
area, but also in activity corresponding to other associations or even other
stimuli in the prefrontal cortex.

Cognitive behaviour requires complex context-dependent processing of information 
that emerges from the links between attentional perceptual processes, working
memory and reward-based evaluation of the performed actions. We describe a
computational neuroscience theoretical framework which shows how an attentional
state held in a short term memory in the prefrontal cortex can by top-down
processing influence ventral and dorsal stream cortical areas using biased
competition to account for many aspects of visual attention. We also show how
within the prefrontal cortex an attentional bias can influence the mapping of
sensory inputs to motor outputs, and thus play an important role in decision
making. We also show how the absence of expected rewards can switch an
attentional bias signal, and thus rapidly and flexibly alter cognitive
performance. This theoretical framework incorporates spiking and synaptic
dynamics which enable single neuron responses, fMRI activations, psychophysical
results, the effects of pharmacological agents, and the effects of damage to
parts of the system to be explicitly simulated and predicted. This computational 
neuroscience framework provides an approach for integrating different levels of
investigation of brain function, and for understanding the relations between
them. The models also directly address how bottom-up and top-down processes
interact in visual cognition, and show how some apparently serial processes
reflect the operation of interacting parallel distributed systems.

The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) is well known to test cognitive
flexibility in terms of set-shifting capabilities. Many fMRI studies with
behaving monkeys as well as human subjects have shown transient neural activity
in the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC), as indicated by an increase in the fMRI signal,
following a rule change in the WCST or when using a WCST-like paradigm. We
present a computational model, covering a limited number of PFC neurons and using
precise biophysical descriptions, which is able to simulate WCS-like tests.
Further, the detailed neuronal representation of the model allows us to calculate
the resulting fMRI signal. Thus, we are able to analyze the adequacy of the model
and its structure by comparing the calculated fMRI signal with the experimental
data which in turn provides promising insights into the neural base of the
increase in the fMRI signal.

Sequential memory: a putative neural and synaptic dynamical mechanism.

Deco G(1), Rolls ET.

Author information: 
(1)ICREA and Universitat Pompeu Fabra.

A key issue in the neurophysiology of cognition is the problem of sequential
learning. Sequential learning refers to the ability to encode and represent the
temporal order of discrete elements occurring in a sequence. We show that the
short-term memory for a sequence of items can be implemented in an
autoassociation neural network. Each item is one of the attractor states of the
network. The autoassociation network is implemented at the level of
integrate-and-fire neurons so that the contributions of different biophysical
mechanisms to sequence learning can be investigated. It is shown that if it is a 
property of the synapses or neurons that support each attractor state that they
adapt, then every time the network is made quiescent (e.g., by inhibition), then 
the attractor state that emerges next is the next item in the sequence. We show
with numerical simulations implementations of the mechanisms using (1) a sodium
inactivation-based spike-frequency-adaptation mechanism, (2) a Ca(2+)-activated
K+ current, and (3) short-term synaptic depression, with sequences of up to three
items. The network does not need repeated training on a particular sequence and
will repeat the items in the order that they were last presented. The time
between the items in a sequence is not fixed, allowing the items to be read out
as required over a period of up to many seconds. The network thus uses adaptation
rather than associative synaptic modification to recall the order of the items in
a recently presented sequence.

Neurodynamics of biased competition and cooperation for attention: a model with
spiking neurons.

Author information:

Recerca i Estudis Avançats, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.

Recent neurophysiological experiments have led to a promising "biased competition
hypothesis" of the neural basis of attention. According to this hypothesis,
attention appears as a sometimes nonlinear property that results from a top-down 
biasing effect that influences the competitive and cooperative interactions that 
work both within cortical areas and between cortical areas. In this paper we
describe a detailed dynamical analysis of the synaptic and neuronal spiking
mechanisms underlying biased competition. We perform a detailed analysis of the
dynamical capabilities of the system by exploring the stationary attractors in
the parameter space by a mean-field reduction consistent with the underlying
synaptic and spiking dynamics. The nonstationary dynamical behavior, as measured 
in neuronal recording experiments, is studied by an integrate-and-fire model with
realistic dynamics. This elucidates the role of cooperation and competition in
the dynamics of biased competition and shows why feedback connections between
cortical areas need optimally to be weaker by a factor of about 2.5 than the
feedforward connections in an attentional network. We modeled the interaction
between top-down attention and bottom-up stimulus contrast effects found
neurophysiologically and showed that top-down attentional effects can be
explained by external attention inputs biasing neurons to move to different parts
of their nonlinear activation functions. Further, it is shown that, although NMDA
nonlinear effects may be useful in attention, they are not necessary, with
nonlinear effects (which may appear multiplicative) being produced in the way
just described.

On the computational basis of a neurodynamical cortical model, we investigate a
specific top-down visual cognitive impairment in brain-damaged patients known as 
visual spatial neglect. The computational cortical model accounts the
neurodynamics underlying selective visual attention, is based on the "biased
competition hypothesis" and structured in several network modules which can be
related with the different areas of the dorsal and ventral path of the visual
cortex. Spatial and object attention are accomplished by a multiplicative gain
control that emerges dynamically through intercortical mutual biased coupling. By
damaging the model in different ways, a variety of dysfunctions associated with
visual neglect can be simulated and explained as disruption of specific
subsystems. Essentially, the damage destabilizes the underlying intra- and
intermodular mutually biased neurodynamical competition that macroscopically
yields the functional deficits observed in visual neglect patients. In
particular, we are able to explain the asymmetrical effect of spatial cueing on
neglect, and the phenomenon of extinction in the framework of visual search.

Modular biased-competition and cooperation: a candidate mechanism for selective
working memory.

Almeida R(1), Deco G, Stetter M.

Germany. ritap.almeida@upf.edu

Prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been suggested to play an important role in executive
cognitive functions, participating in planning and controlling behaviour. The
results of several recent electrophysiological studies indicate that PFC might be
involved not only in the active maintenance of information but in doing so in a
context- or task-dependent manner. In a delayed-match-to-sample paradigm,
recordings from neurons in the PFC showed their ability to selectively represent 
information, which is needed for task completion, suggesting that task-irrelevant
information does not access working memory. We present a neurodynamical
computational model of a part of the PFC to account for the selective
representation of information in working memory. We show that a network of
biological realistic integrate-and-fire excitatory and inhibitory neurons,
implementing the mechanisms of local or modular biased-competition, which is
transmitted through cooperation to different subsets of neuronal pools, can
explain the formation of selective context-dependent working memory. The modes of
operation of the network are characterized and the corresponding parameter
settings revealed. Modular competition and cooperation might constitute general
mechanisms for implementing context-dependent formation of working memory.

This paper presents a model on the potential functional roles of the early visual
cortex in the primate visual system. Our hypothesis is that early visual areas,
such as V1, are important for continual interaction among various higher order
visual areas during visual processing. The interaction is mediated by recurrent
connections between higher order visual areas and V1, manifested in the
long-latency context-sensitive activities often observed in neurophysiological
experiments, and is responsible for the re-integration of information analysed by
the higher visual areas. Specifically, we considered the case of integrating
'what' and 'where' information from the ventral and dorsal streams. We found that
such a cortical architecture provides simple solutions and fresh insights into
the problems of attentional routing and visual search. The computational
viability of this architecture was tested by simulating a large-scale neural
dynamical network.

Synaptic and spiking dynamics underlying reward reversal in the orbitofrontal
cortex.

Cognitive and emotional flexibility involve a coordinated interaction between
working memory, attention, reward expectations, and the evaluation of rewards and
punishers so that behaviour can be changed if necessary. We describe a model at
the integrate-and-fire neuronal level of the synaptic and spiking mechanisms
which can hold an expectation of a reward rule in working memory, and can reverse
the reward rule if expected rewards are not obtained. An example of a reward rule
is that stimulus 1 is currently associated with reward, and stimulus 2 with
punishment. The attractor-based reward rule working memory incorporates a
spike-frequency synaptic adaptation mechanism which supports the neural switching
between rules by being shut down by a general inhibitory input produced by
punishment, so that when the attractor starts up again is in the opposite state. 
The mechanism can implement one-trial reward reversal, which is a property of
orbitofrontal cortex neurons. We show how this reward rule input can operate in a
biased competition way to influence which one of two stimuli is currently
associated with reward and which with punishment, and to map the stimuli
correctly to the reward or punishment representations, providing a basis for
action selection required to obtain the reinforcer.

"What" and "where" in visual working memory: a computational neurodynamical
perspective for integrating FMRI and single-neuron data.

Deco G(1), Rolls ET, Horwitz B.

Author information: 
(1)Institucion Catalana de Recerca, Estudis Avançats (ICREA) and Universitat
Pompeu Fabra.

Single-neuron recordings, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and 
the effects of lesions indicate that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in
some types of working memory and related cognitive processes. Based on these
data, two different models of the topographical and functional organization of
the PFC have been proposed: organization-by-stimulus-domain, and
organization-by-process. In this article, we utilize an integrate-and-fire
network to model both single-neuron and fMRI data on short-term memory in order
to understand data obtained in topologically different parts of the PFC during
working memory tasks. We explicitly model the mechanisms that underlie working
memory-related activity during the execution of delay tasks that have a
"what"-then-"where" design (with both object and spatial delayed responses within
the same trial). The model contains different populations of neurons (as found
experimentally) in attractor networks that respond in the delay period to the
stimulus object, the stimulus position, and to combinations of both object and
position information. The pools are arranged hierarchically and have global
inhibition through inhibitory interneurons to implement competition. It is shown 
that a biasing attentional input to define the current relevant information
(object or location) enables the system to select the correct neuronal
populations during the delay period in what is a biased competition model of
attention. The processes occurring at the AMPA and NMDA synapses are dynamically 
modeled in the integrate-and-fire implementation to produce realistic spiking
dynamics. It is shown that the fMRI data characteristic of the dorsal PFC and
linked to spatial processing and manipulation of items can be reproduced in the
model by a high level of inhibition, whereas the fMRI data characteristic of the 
ventral PFC and linked to object processing can be produced by a lower level of
inhibition, even though the network is itself topographically homogeneous with no
spatial topology of the neurons. This article, thus, not only presents a model
for how spatial versus object short-term memory could be implemented in the PFC, 
but also shows that the fMRI BOLD signal measured during such tasks from
different parts of the PFC could reflect a higher level of inhibition dorsally,
without this dorsal region necessarily being primarily spatial and the ventral
region object-related.

Cooperation and biased competition model can explain attentional filtering in the
prefrontal cortex.

Recent neurophysiological experimental results suggest that the prefrontal cortex
plays an important role in filtering out unattended visual inputs. Here we
propose a neurodynamical computational model of a part of the prefrontal cortex
to account for the neural mechanisms defining this attentional filtering effect. 
Similar models have been employed to explain experimental results obtained during
the performance of attention and working memory tasks. In this previous work the 
principle of biased competition was shown to successfully account for the
experimental data. To model the attentional filtering effect, the biased
competition model was extended to enable cooperation between stimulus selective
neurons. We show that, in a biological relevant minimal model, competition and
cooperation between the neurons are sufficient conditions for reproducing the
attentional effect. Furthermore, a characterization of the parameter regime where
the cooperation effect is observed is presented. Finally, we also reveal
parameter regimes where the network has different modes of operation: selective
working memory, attentional filtering, pure competition and noncompetitive
amplification.

We use a computational neuroscience approach to study the role of feature-based
attention in visual perception. This model is used to numerically simulate a
visual attention experiment. The neurodynamical system consists of many
interconnected modules that can be related to the dorsal and ventral paths of the
visual cortex. The biased competition hypothesis is taken into account within the
model. From the experimental point of view, measurements exist, which confirm
that feature-based attention influences visual cortical responses to stimuli
outside the attended location. These measurements show that attention to a given 
stimulus attribute (in this case "color red") increases the response of cortical 
visual areas to a spatially distant, ignored stimulus that shares the same
attribute. Our neurodynamical model is used to numerically compute the neural
activity of area V4 corresponding to such ignored stimulus, giving a good
description of the experimental data.

We describe a model of invariant visual object recognition in the brain that
incorporates feedback biasing effects of top-down attentional mechanisms on a
hierarchically organized set of visual cortical areas with convergent forward
connectivity, reciprocal feedback connections, and local intra-area competition. 
The model displays space-based and object-based covert visual search by using
attentional top-down feedback from either the posterior parietal or the inferior 
temporal cortex (IT) modules, and interactions between the two processing streams
occurring in V1 and V2. The model explains the gradually increasing magnitude of 
the attentional modulation that is found in fMRI experiments from earlier visual 
areas (V1, V2) to higher ventral stream visual areas (V4, IT); how the effective 
size of the receptive fields of IT neurons becomes smaller in natural cluttered
scenes; and makes predictions about interactions between stimuli in their
receptive fields.

Cognitive behaviour requires complex context-dependent mapping between sensory
stimuli and actions. The same stimulus can lead to different behaviours depending
on the situation, or the same behaviour may be elicited by different cueing
stimuli. Neurons in the primate prefrontal cortex show task-specific firing
activity during working memory delay periods. These neurons provide a neural
substrate for mapping stimulus and response in a flexible, context- or
rule-dependent, fashion. We describe here an integrate-and-fire network model to 
explain and investigate the different types of working-memory-related neuronal
activity observed. The model contains different populations (or pools) of neurons
(as found neurophysiologically) in attractor networks which respond in the delay 
period to the stimulus object, the stimulus position ('sensory pools'), to
combinations of the stimulus sensory properties (e.g. the object identity or
object location) and the response ('intermediate pools'), and to the response
required (left or right) ('premotor pools'). The pools are arranged
hierarchically, are linked by associative synaptic connections, and have global
inhibition through inhibitory interneurons to implement competition. It is shown 
that a biasing attentional input to define the current rule applied to the
intermediate pools enables the system to select the correct response in what is a
biased competition model of attention. The integrate-and-fire model not only
produces realistic spiking dynamicals very similar to the neuronal data but also 
shows how dopamine could weaken and shorten the persistent neuronal activity in
the delay period; and allows us to predict more response errors when dopamine is 
elevated because there is less different activity in the different pools of
competing neurons, resulting in more conflict.

Object-based visual neglect: a computational hypothesis.

Some patients with damage to the right parietal cortex show neglect for the left 
half of each of a series of objects shown in a horizontal row in the visual
field. The neglect is thus not based on failure to see objects in any part of
left visual space, but is object-based. We show that in a model of attention with
separate V1, object (inferior temporal cortex, IT) and spatial (posterior
parietal cortex, PP) modules the effect can arise after graded damage increasing 
towards the right of the PP module when the lateral inhibition between neurons in
the PP and V1 modules is short-range. The local lateral inhibition produces high 
contrast effects at the edges of each object, and it is when this interacts with 
gradually increasing damage through the left visual field that the visibility of 
the left half of each object is especially impaired. This result was found in a
formal model completely specified by mean field equations to quantify the
dynamical interactions between the modules. This is the first quantitative
account of object-based neglect found in humans with right parietal cortex
damage, and provides evidence that the model of attention we describe can account
for even detailed and extraordinary phenomena that can occur in visual
perception.

Historically, the psychophysical evidence for "selective attention" originated
mainly from visual search experiments. A first important distinction in the
processing of information in visual search tasks is its separation in two stages.
The first, early "preattentive" stage operates in parallel across the entire
visual field extracting single "primitive features" without integrating them. The
second "attentive" stage corresponds to the specialized integration of
information from a limited part of the field at any one time, i.e. serially. So
far, models based on the above mentioned two-stage processes have been able to
distinguish features from conjunction search conditions based on the observed
slopes of the linear relation between reaction time (i.e., search time) and the
number of items in the stimulus array. We propose a neuroscience based model for 
visual attention that works across the visual field in parallel, but due to its
intrinsic dynamics can show the two experimentally observed modes of visual
attention, namely: the serial focal attention and the parallel spread of
attention over space. The model demonstrates that neither explicit serial focal
search nor saliency maps need to be assumed. In the present model the focus of
attention is not included in the system but only emerges after convergence of the
dynamical behaviour of the neural networks. Furthermore, existing models have not
been able to explain the variation of slopes observed in different kinds of
conjunction search modes. We hypothesize that the different slopes can be
explained by assuming that selective attention is guided by an independent
mechanism which corresponds to the independent search for each feature. The model
consistently integrates the different neuroscience levels by considering the
microscopic neurodynamical mechanism that underlies visual attention, the
different brain areas of the dorsal or "where" and ventral or "what" paths of the
visual cortex, and behavioural data.

A computational neuroscience framework is proposed to better understand the role 
and the neuronal correlate of spatial attention modulation in visual perception. 
The model consists of several interconnected modules that can be related to the
different areas of the dorsal and ventral paths of the visual cortex. Competitive
neural interactions are implemented at both microscopic and interareal levels,
according to the biased competition hypothesis. This hypothesis has been
experimentally confirmed in studies in humans using functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) techniques and also in single-cell recording studies in monkeys.
Within this neuro-dynamical approach, numerical simulations are carried out that 
describe both the fMRI and the electrophysiological data. The proposed model
draws together data of different spatial and temporal resolution, as are the
above-mentioned imaging and single-cell results.
